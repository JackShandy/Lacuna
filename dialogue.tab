Well, we can't have this sort of thing going on, Brilebrogue, I said to myself, and so I paid the blighter a visit and gave her a stern talking-to, and no mistake. She renounced his ways in an instant and placed all the dreams back exactly where he found them, promising to reform her ways and be a better woman.

Of course I gave him my assurances immediately, and thus he told me that the devil's seven daughters were locked below the city in chains, and could only be released with the most secret and magical word, "Grolabicon"! Of course if this were ever to be discovered and the daughters released, they would wreak such terrible havoc on the world as to bring the Firmament crashing down from Her place up above, and it would be the seventh and final apocalypse come at last, which is why I gave him my word that I would keep the secret safe as houses, and I have never told anyone of the matter to this day.	game/script.rpy	2395	f "[what]"

thiefSoloMenu_332c8036		You fell into a chair and looked around.	game/script.rpy	4823	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_6c685cc3		This part of the train was some kind of bar or gambling hall. Looking up through a maze of trapdoors in the roof, you could see there were many floors stacked above this one. Bathhouses, gardens, workshops and observatories.	game/script.rpy	4826	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_cdf8b1e9		Your pig nestled into the chair beside you and began to chat to the nearby goblins in the language of mud.	game/script.rpy	4828	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_9cd18470		The thief whirled through the room - juggling, twisting, dancing, the life of the party.	game/script.rpy	4829	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_0002190c		Something was wrong with the inside of the carriage. You couldn't put your finger on it.	game/script.rpy	4830	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_7b3fcc27		Something you couldn't see. In your blind spot.	game/script.rpy	4831	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_d745715f		A team of goblins hung off the back of the train and picked up the tracks behind it, then climbed around to hand the tracks to the goblins at the front, who laid them in front of the train as it squeezed through the trees of the forest.	game/script.rpy	4837	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_7da01306		The wind howled like a wild beast.	game/script.rpy	4838	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_46d55367	t	Let's get some music going!	game/script.rpy	4839	t "[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_19e0f22d		The goblin band struck up a wild tune. The thief gestured to push them to play louder and louder until you couldn't even hear the wind outside.	game/script.rpy	4842	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_93bd1081		You felt your vision warping, for some reason you couldn't define. Like staring into a magic eye puzzle.	game/script.rpy	4843	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_d4e11551		The goblins poured you dozens of goblin brews, bubbling ales and steaming warm ciders, goblin wines that oozed with red fog and goblin brandies that froze and melted and froze again as you drank them.	game/script.rpy	4849	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_53e314f0		The thief challenged the largest goblin to a drinking competition and drank them under the table.	game/script.rpy	4850	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_634dc700		Foolishly, you drank deeply of the brews. You guzzled them down until you could drink no more, until your vision was a haze and the brew ran down your mouth and drenched your clothes, and still you thirsted for them.	game/script.rpy	4851	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_05c96d8c		From that day on, no other drink would ever be able to quench your thirst, and you would always shiver and feel cold without the wild drunken feeling of warmth the goblin drinks gave you.	game/script.rpy	4852	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_8b0a6fbf		You managed to corner the thief as they laughed in a group of goblins.	game/script.rpy	4856	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_01d81847	pov	Why did you grab me and take me here?	game/script.rpy	4857	pov "[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_7405edb5	t	It is my nature! Nothing more.	game/script.rpy	4858	t "[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_6c702751	t	I am the greatest thief of my generation. I was raised by these goblins to steal the moon and sun and stars, and now I have stolen you away.	game/script.rpy	4859	t "[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_f579cd87		They laughed wildly. Their face was slick with sweat.	game/script.rpy	4860	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_95593600	t	Nothing at all!	game/script.rpy	4874	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_d940ed94		They wiped the sweat from their forehead and gave you a charming smile. Their fingers were twisting and twitching rapidly, like they couldn't keep still.	game/script.rpy	4875	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_296e70fe	t	Everything is as it should be. In fact, this is the best it's ever been. Come, let us dance!	game/script.rpy	4876	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_48f4ee12		They took your hand in a dance that spiralled out of control. The music was deafening. The goblin faces whirled around you until you were breathless.	game/script.rpy	4877	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_f392e4d5	t	Nonsense! There's so much joy to be had here. Stay, and celebrate with us.	game/script.rpy	4885	t "[what]"

thiefSoloConvo_ac39a7d0	t	 I don't want to be alone when it comes.	game/script.rpy	4888	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_af237791		Then it reappeared like nothing had happened. They drank deeply of their goblin wine and gestured for you to do the same.	game/script.rpy	4889	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_7ff669f0	t	Bedlam! I think a celebration like this calls for some smoke.	game/script.rpy	4890	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_bd072e07		A goblin creature shaped like a sack full of rats nodded, and started throwing herbs into the fire.	game/script.rpy	4891	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_b2ae0f06		Purple, twinkling smoke began to ooze out of it. As you breathed it in, your vision twisted and your limbs began to feel far away.	game/script.rpy	4892	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_7344494d		The thief twisted away from you, but you managed to track them down at the dice tables. The mass of goblins seethed around you.	game/script.rpy	4901	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_79b4ab87	pov	I need you to tell me what's going on.	game/script.rpy	4902	pov "[what]"

thiefSoloConvo_a4fb507e	pov	I don't know how to explain it, but I feel... more alone. More than I've ever been before.	game/script.rpy	4904	pov "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_ae403ca4	t	Don't worry about them, my friend. They made their choice. We all did!	game/script.rpy	4905	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_63711814		They rolled the dice and raised their hands in triumph. The goblins around the table groaned and pushed a stack of rocks over to them.	game/script.rpy	4906	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_ab89a165		The music stopped. You looked around to see that the carriage was empty around you.	game/script.rpy	4916	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_fe9369ec		It had always been empty.	game/script.rpy	4917	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_f97cff5d	t	I don't think this train is going fast enough, haha!	game/script.rpy	4918	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_e1da650b		Juggling spoons with their right hand, they grabbed you and pulled you through the empty carriage towards the engine room.	game/script.rpy	4919	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_2ad1e5ef		You burst out of the carriage door and into the cool night air. Without the sound of the music, you could hear the wind howling like a banshee.	game/script.rpy	4922	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_9f2d06af		The thief pulled you through and into the engine room, where four sooty goblins were lounging.	game/script.rpy	4926	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_534064ec	t	Stoke the engine, will you? Let's see how fast this thing can move!	game/script.rpy	4927	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_bc689e0a	goblin4	Aye, boss!	game/script.rpy	4928	goblin4 "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_67e50aa7		The three goblins grabbed their shovels and set to work piling coal into the engine. The heat was intense.	game/script.rpy	4929	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_3ca1c0ea		You looked out the window. It was pitch black outside.	game/script.rpy	4932	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_031d5b44		The train moved faster and faster, and you could hear sparks coming off the wheels.	game/script.rpy	4939	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_6c5bb805		Your thoughts were jumbled and fractured.	game/script.rpy	4940	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_c9d12d6f		You heard something. Like claws, scrabbling in the mechanism underneath the carriage.	game/script.rpy	4949	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_2ee4dccf	pov	Do you hear-	game/script.rpy	4952	pov "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_51602938	t	Nothing to worry about! Just the wind!	game/script.rpy	4953	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_2742d0c9	t	Help me shovel this coal, will you?	game/script.rpy	4954	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_49b213d7		You looked around. The engine room was empty, except for you and the thief.	game/script.rpy	4955	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_388681bf		You picked up a shovel and held it.	game/script.rpy	4956	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_bc57beec	pov	Listen. I'll help you shovel if you tell me what's happening here.	game/script.rpy	4957	pov "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_75b23826		You could feel the confusion blooming in your brain. Expanding blank spaces like tumours.	game/script.rpy	4958	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_dcb64f28	pov	What's happening to me? To us? What... is this?	game/script.rpy	4959	pov "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_53764426		The thief sighed.	game/script.rpy	4960	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_6715f7e8	t	Alright. Just, please - help me shovel.	game/script.rpy	4961	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_1e08f047		You both began to shove coal into the furnace. The fire flared and the room grew hotter and hotter as the train sped up.	game/script.rpy	4962	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_233e8287		The thief looked into the flames.	game/script.rpy	4963	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_d23813a0	t	I made a deal. A long time ago.	game/script.rpy	4964	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_c6c7bdbf	t	We all took it. You will, too, in the end.	game/script.rpy	4965	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_96f600f5	t	Today, my debt is due. It's the end of the line.	game/script.rpy	4966	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_9846193f		The flames reflected in their dark eyes.	game/script.rpy	4967	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_b2d694ea	t	Ah, well.	game/script.rpy	4968	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_4acd6619	t	Everyone gets eaten by something. Might as well be this.	game/script.rpy	4969	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_25652915		The train screeched as it rounded a tight bend, sending you both stumbling.	game/script.rpy	4970	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_e607e68d	t	I think that's as fast as it'll go.	game/script.rpy	4971	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_d62fbf88	t	Come on. Let's spend the last moment in the moonlight.	game/script.rpy	4972	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_9388a762		They took your hand, and in a single twist of their long, long arms they pulled you both out of the engine and up onto the roof of the train.	game/script.rpy	4975	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_02d4ce07		You looked out across the night landscape. The land was haunted and beautiful. The smoke stung your eyes.	game/script.rpy	4976	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_675ac6c0	t	Here. I still have this.	game/script.rpy	4977	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_0ba2692b		They waved an ornate bottle of champagne at you.	game/script.rpy	4978	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_1de2cfc3	t	From my father's cellar. One of the first things I ever stole. I was saving it for a special occasion.	game/script.rpy	4979	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_51fe7993		They popped the cork.	game/script.rpy	4980	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_033cb47c	t	Don't worry. It's not goblin drink.	game/script.rpy	4981	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_3d16de59		They offered you a swig from the bottle as the train hurtled forward, teetering off the rails.	game/script.rpy	4982	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_2c4c1e82		You could hear something in the darkness behind you. Like the thudding of great paws.	game/script.rpy	4984	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_d54f7ee9	t	I had to do it.	game/script.rpy	4986	t "[what]"

thiefSoloConvo2_0600b2a6	t	A tree with nothing at the root.	game/script.rpy	4988	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_66454648	t	The real world holds nothing for us. All we can do is extract as much joy as we can from each single day.	game/script.rpy	4990	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_451943e6	t	Until we finally take the westward line.	game/script.rpy	4991	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_e77aeba7		They took a swig from the champagne bottle.	game/script.rpy	4992	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_3b5d9fad		The howling wind abated for a single moment. The air was clear. The moon emerged from the clouds.	game/script.rpy	4996	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_649d12d9		The thief leaned off the train, holding onto the smoke stack with one hand and the champagne bottle with the other.	game/script.rpy	4997	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_0aade1ed	t	Well. This is it.	game/script.rpy	4998	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_c27940e5		You looked at their face. It was fierce with exaltation. A ferocious laugh split their mouth.	game/script.rpy	4999	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_76a25d97	t	I did it.	game/script.rpy	5000	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_7ca277b8	t	I'm not sorry, you hear me?	game/script.rpy	5001	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_c775d6c3	t	I struck out from the cruelty and bleakness and grey endless grinding of that machine, and I lived every day I was alive.	game/script.rpy	5002	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_8d28b4e5		Their laughter faded and they looked out at the moon with relief. They handed you the champagne.	game/script.rpy	5003	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_77d48502	t	I won.	game/script.rpy	5004	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_ab383527		The wind returned, howling like a monstrous beast.	game/script.rpy	5005	"[what]"

thiefSoloConvo2_54a212f4		They gave you a sudden shove in the centre of your chest. You fell sprawling from the roof and slammed into the dirt, tumbling down the side of the hill and away from the train.	game/script.rpy	5011	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_50e1de58		The train hurtled past you in a blaze of smoke and fire, and then was gone.	game/script.rpy	5012	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_3cb34276		You lay in the underbrush, catching your breath, before staggering up.	game/script.rpy	5020	"[what]"

thiefSoloConvo2_84fe170d		You heard a soft grunting coming from the bush.	game/script.rpy	5027	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_381ba792		The bushes rustled, and then your pig leapt out and into your arms, oinking joyfully. You cradled it softly.	game/script.rpy	5028	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_cde4c791		You picked yourself up and begin the long walk back home with the pig.	game/script.rpy	5029	"[what]"

mushroom1_2f540422		The mushroom ushered you and your pig inside, and you both took a seat in the plush red armchairs. Your pig snuffled around, searching for truffles. You pretended to sip a cup of decaying leaf matter as you told your tale.	game/script.rpy	5061	"[what]"

mushroomExplore_a6885655	mir	Finally.	game/script.rpy	5417	mir "[what]"
mushroomExplore_2d6bded3		A crooked red hand fell on your shoulder, and you turned to see the cackling face of the old serpent himself.	game/script.rpy	5418	"[what]"
mushroomExplore_eaa11591	mir	Now you see that no matter how long you hide, none can escape the devil's clutches! Come with me, and we will dance together in Hell forever.	game/script.rpy	5419	mir "[what]"
mushroomBox_c6dcbd09		Having lost everything dear to you, you realised that there was no reason not to open it.	game/script.rpy	5429	"[what]"
mushroomBox_f066017e	pov	At such a time, surely I will find something inside this box to save me and lead me back to the Mushroom.	game/script.rpy	5430	pov "[what]"

mushroomBox_41600035	mir	What are you doing? No!	game/script.rpy	5434	mir "[what]"
mushroomBox_4d1fdaba		You untied the red silk and lifted the lid of the precious box.	game/script.rpy	5435	"[what]"
mushroomBox_44b9e94a		As soon as you did, all of your years rushed out of the box, and they came upon you at once. Your hair grew and turned white, your back twisted into a knot with age, your face wrinkled up and you fell down dead in an instant.	game/script.rpy	5436	"[what]"
mushroomBox_f40a3fba		Poor thing! I wept to see your woeful fate. Because of your disobedience, never would you live to see your loved ones again.	game/script.rpy	5439	"[what]"
mushroomBox_8ed30a81		Little children, never be disobedient to those who are wiser than you, for disobedience is the mother of all misery and father of all woe.	game/script.rpy	5441	"[what]"

mushroomBox_00620a41		Oh?	game/script.rpy	5448	"[what]"
mushroomBox_1d169db6		And what happened to the thief, you ask?	game/script.rpy	5450	"[what]"
mushroomBox_224c125a		Long did they run from the law.	game/script.rpy	5454	"[what]"
mushroomBox_f0dabfa2		Over hill and dale, through the valleys, under the mountains and across the sea they ran.	game/script.rpy	5455	"[what]"
mushroomBox_1afaf126		Finally one night, they ran deep into the desert.	game/script.rpy	5456	"[what]"
mushroomBox_aa8bae44		They caught their breath and looked around. The sky was vast and empty above them.	game/script.rpy	5457	"[what]"
mushroomBox_6805ba5e		No-one was there.	game/script.rpy	5458	"[what]"

mushroomBox_fb9a55f6		You hesitated - but in the end you couldn't bring yourself to break your promise to the mushroom.	game/script.rpy	5468	"[what]"
mushroomBox_8bc33d92		And so the Lord took you, and you rested in the basement of His White House forever and ever, until the final horn and the coming of the end of days.	game/script.rpy	5470	"[what]"

mushroomBox_a1ee734d_2		They were never seen or heard from again.	game/script.rpy	5521	"[what]"
mushroomBox_0d5f3033		And so you stayed there, forever searching for an entrance back to that kingdom you missed so much.	game/script.rpy	5524	"[what]"
mushroomBox_b3385fc1		For years you searched, with no success. Soon, the Ash Giants came upon the world, and you felt their searing light upon your skin.	game/script.rpy	5525	"[what]"
mushroomBox_0f3cd88f		As the light burnt you away, you felt something take hold of you and draw you into the earth.	game/script.rpy	5526	"[what]"

mushroomBox_3cae98cc	m	You've returned.	game/script.rpy	5528	m "[what]"
mushroomBox_b7c02d24		Your pig jumped out from the arms of the mushroom and danced around you in glee.	game/script.rpy	5530	"[what]"

toad1_7d198a09		He gulped down the rest of his plate and stumbled unsteadily away from the table.	game/script.rpy	5564	"[what]"
toad1_12ac60e8		You, the toad and the pig stepped into the toad's squash carriage, and it went rattling away down the path into the great, dark rainforest.	game/script.rpy	5566	"[what]"
toad1_4681ae2f		You both stepped into the toad's squash carriage, and it went rattling away down the path into the great, dark rainforest.	game/script.rpy	5568	"[what]"
toad1_f58fdaeb		As you went down the road, the forest began to get darker and darker.	game/script.rpy	5571	"[what]"
toad1_39203e4e		The trees closed in like a wall around you, and the moon and stars fled in fear.	game/script.rpy	5572	"[what]"
toad1_890adacb	f	Nothing to fear, my friend! My boys will get us through this dark road, quick smart!	game/script.rpy	5573	f "[what]"
toad1_4cd6097b		He waved the crow-shrike, the rat, the bat and the old black cockatoo onwards. But instead of going faster, they slowed down and came to a stop.	game/script.rpy	5574	"[what]"
toad1_b606f4c2	f	What? Why are you stopping?	game/script.rpy	5575	f "[what]"
toad1_dffc5902	crowshrike	Well... now seems as good a time as any.	game/script.rpy	5576	crowshrike "[what]"
toad1_4dc34cab	rat	We've been meaning to have a bit of a chat with you, mate.	game/script.rpy	5577	rat "[what]"
toad1_d7fa0eca	bat	About the payment situation.	game/script.rpy	5578	bat "[what]"
toad1_66594f08		The toad coughed nervously.	game/script.rpy	5580	"[what]"
toad1_8854ed73	f	I-I assure you fellows, the check is in the mail...	game/script.rpy	5581	f "[what]"
toad1_1e4ec77d	cockatoo	Not good enough. Get him, boys!	game/script.rpy	5582	cockatoo "[what]"
toad1_4ed18ba3		And with that they fell on the toad and took him for all he was worth and dumped him on the side of the road.	game/script.rpy	5583	"[what]"
toad1_2b015e8a		Then they turned to you and respectfully escorted you from the carriage.	game/script.rpy	5584	"[what]"
toad1_fdceaf7e	crowshrike	Sorry about all that. You seem nice enough. Good luck with it.	game/script.rpy	5588	crowshrike "[what]" nointeract

toad1_f1258eae	crowshrike	If you live through it, come get a drink with us sometime.	game/script.rpy	5594	crowshrike "[what]"
toad1_d0a96da9	bat	Back to the feast, I reckon.	game/script.rpy	5596	bat "[what]"
toad1_f99e90e3	bat	There's some mangos in the gutter with my name on them.	game/script.rpy	5597	bat "[what]"
toad1_abfd388e		They jumped in the old rotten squash and rode it away back to the village, leaving you, the toad and the pig on the side of the road.	game/script.rpy	5599	"[what]"
toad1_7ecf522d		They jumped in the old rotten squash and rode it away back to the village, leaving you both on the side of the road.	game/script.rpy	5601	"[what]"
toad1_16d222d1	f	...Uh...	game/script.rpy	5602	f "[what]"
toad1_8b8afecd	f	A-another successful adventure! Good thing I was able to fight off those ruffians!	game/script.rpy	5603	f "[what]"
toad1_072c6977		He coughed up some mud from the ditch, shuddering weakly.	game/script.rpy	5604	"[what]"
toad1_65dd26db		Then he stood up and said to himself sternly:	game/script.rpy	5605	"[what]"
toad1_47a5c784	f	I am Bridlebrogue Chippingham, and I've never failed at anything in my life.	game/script.rpy	5606	f "[what]"
toad1_01cb5bff		With this, he regained his former swagger and strode forward.	game/script.rpy	5607	"[what]"
toad1_76078d80		The night grew dark.	game/script.rpy	5608	"[what]"
toad1_20a97d78		You walked through the trees together.	game/script.rpy	5609	"[what]"
toad1_3573de1c		The Firmament looked down at you from Her place up above.	game/script.rpy	5612	"[what]"
toad1_8c4e262a	pov	How do you know where the witch's cottage is?	game/script.rpy	5621	pov "[what]"
toad1_f21180ae	f	Oh... just my natural good sense of direction, I suppose! Ha ha!	game/script.rpy	5622	f "[what]"
toad1_7a829e33	f	When you become an adventurer like me, you just know these things.	game/script.rpy	5623	f "[what]"
toad1_5313148f	pov	Have you been through this part of the forest before?	game/script.rpy	5625	pov "[what]"
toad1_dacfc0e3	f	Oh... no, of course not. No, I'm far too busy being off at more important places, with more important people. All across the world. Barely have a moment to myself, you know.	game/script.rpy	5626	f "[what]"
toad1_2fefba53	f	I wouldn't have the slightest idea what it's like to live in a swamp like this. Ha. Ha.	game/script.rpy	5627	f "[what]"
toad1_724422ec	f	Come on, we can't let ourselves be cowed by a little darkness! Why, I remember when I was journeying through the pits of Arborkios, where darkness is forged on a black anvil of star-stuff, and the blackest night shelters for rest each night after being torn apart by the light of day each morning! Well, I marched right on through that black pit, and I said -	game/script.rpy	5628	f "[what]"
toad1_fbf3e6bc	f	Ack!	game/script.rpy	5629	f "[what]"
toad1_6a39c858		You heard him trip over in front of you and go tumbling down and down through the muck of the rainforest until he fell into a deep pit and landed at the bottom with a crash.	game/script.rpy	5630	"[what]"
toad1_0f1f9765		You picked your way carefully down to him.	game/script.rpy	5631	"[what]"
toad1_01df78fb	f	Never fear! I have found... a shortcut!	game/script.rpy	5632	f "[what]"
toad1_86f1e3dd		The pig pushed the toad with its snout.	game/script.rpy	5634	"[what]"
toad1_dcddb205	f	I just... need a moment. M-might have... sprained my ankle there, I think. And maybe my arm.	game/script.rpy	5635	f "[what]"
toad1_9d860f48		He wheezed and lay there in the mud for a long time, breathing heavily and trying not to cry.	game/script.rpy	5636	"[what]"
toad1_70d36b2f		You heard him whisper to himself weakly.	game/script.rpy	5637	"[what]"
toad1_9bdd426e	f	I am B-brildebrogue Chippingham. And I...	game/script.rpy	5638	f "[what]"
toad1_dfecfe3d		You reached down and found the toad's hand.	game/script.rpy	5646	"[what]"
toad1_7b4b773a		Even in the darkness, you saw him blush bright red.	game/script.rpy	5647	"[what]"
toad1_3c00f237	f	Well I - t-this is all most...	game/script.rpy	5648	f "[what]"
toad1_0d20b017	f	Hand-holding, before marriage? What will people say?	game/script.rpy	5649	f "[what]"
toad1_418ee78d		You picked him up out of the muck and put him on your shoulder.	game/script.rpy	5650	"[what]"
toad1_79a2cd79	f	Good, good. I-I'll lead you onward.	game/script.rpy	5651	f "[what]"
toad1_faef132d		You walked on. Soon, you began to see a glimmer of silver light in the darkness.	game/script.rpy	5652	"[what]"
toad1_645a2813		The forest was covered in great puddles of water from the rains. The puddles shone with light.	game/script.rpy	5655	"[what]"
toad1_0a2eced7		All around you, the woods were dark and empty. But when you looked into the water, you saw the reflection of a shining cottage below.	game/script.rpy	5656	"[what]"
toad1_0ae9bcd0			game/script.rpy	5660	"[what]"
toad1_1668d521		For a brief moment, you thought you saw a figure reflected in the water. But as soon as you blinked, it was gone.	game/script.rpy	5665	"[what]"
puddle_e7f50077		You crawled to the edge and looked down into the puddle.	game/script.rpy	5677	"[what]"
puddle_7cd147f0		The surface of the water was flat and still.	game/script.rpy	5678	"[what]"
puddle_307d5c87		The cottage in the reflection shone with bright light, as if the setting sun was behind it.	game/script.rpy	5681	"[what]"
puddle_61023088		There was no trace of a cottage in the world above the water.	game/script.rpy	5684	"[what]"
puddle_26014a45		You picked up a stick from the ground, and tossed it into the puddle.	game/script.rpy	5688	"[what]"
puddle_ff499cad		It fell in without a single ripple in the water.	game/script.rpy	5689	"[what]"
puddle_ac59d260		You saw it drop through into the reflection, and land close to the cottage.	game/script.rpy	5690	"[what]"
puddle_37e73c24		You looked up. There was no trace of it in the world outside the reflection.	game/script.rpy	5691	"[what]"
puddle_7be3ad39		You grabbed the pig and the toad to you, then leapt into the puddle.	game/script.rpy	5696	"[what]"
puddle_7b024584		You held the toad tight, then leapt into the puddle.	game/script.rpy	5698	"[what]"
puddle_34bd7779		The world flipped over.	game/script.rpy	5701	"[what]"
puddle_17e60d48		You felt the water pass over you, and a cool chill tingled all through your body.	game/script.rpy	5702	"[what]"
puddle_f108985a		When you opened your eyes, you were standing right way up again.	game/script.rpy	5705	"[what]"
puddle_0fec5802		The puddle you had jumped into was now a floor, like a silver mirror.	game/script.rpy	5706	"[what]"
puddle_f590bf40		The world all around you shone white.	game/script.rpy	5707	"[what]"
puddle_fb1d5a14		At the centre of the puddle was the cottage, shining with light.	game/script.rpy	5708	"[what]"
puddle_d9f83a34		The toad was very quiet now. His fine suit was ruined with mud. He jumped out of your hand and sat down.	game/script.rpy	5709	"[what]"
puddle_43df4ffe	f	You'd... better go on. I'd just slow you down.	game/script.rpy	5711	f "[what]"
puddle_952da51c	pov	Thanks for pretending to fall down back there.	game/script.rpy	5718	pov "[what]"
puddle_e956e03d	f	What?	game/script.rpy	5719	f "[what]"
puddle_71665a20	pov	Well, I know you must have done it deliberately. Just so I would have something to do.	game/script.rpy	5720	pov "[what]"
puddle_35a3c170	pov	After all, you were leading us here so easily!	game/script.rpy	5721	pov "[what]"
puddle_73d48273	pov	Thanks for making me feel included.	game/script.rpy	5722	pov "[what]"
puddle_8edfe287	f	Oh. I...	game/script.rpy	5723	f "[what]"
puddle_cc1ced25		He brightened up.	game/script.rpy	5724	"[what]"
puddle_e0d9490e	f	Yes, I had to make sure you were included! We're both on this adventure together, after all. We're a team.	game/script.rpy	5725	f "[what]"
puddle_08eefaa0		You saw him start to smile shakily.	game/script.rpy	5726	"[what]"
puddle_b26898cd	f	I did do an ok job getting us here, didn't I?	game/script.rpy	5727	f "[what]"
puddle_92095506	pov	Of course!	game/script.rpy	5728	pov "[what]"
puddle_313de22f		You gently slapped him across the back.	game/script.rpy	5729	"[what]"
puddle_c4b62cf1	pov	You're Brildebrogue Chippingham, and you've never failed at anything in your life.	game/script.rpy	5730	pov "[what]"
puddle_125bfe54		With this, the toad wiped the tears from his eyes, and beamed.	game/script.rpy	5731	"[what]"
puddle_10365580	pov	You have. It would be better if you'd never come.	game/script.rpy	5733	pov "[what]"
puddle_263bf7dd		The toad winced and looked away, trying not to cry.	game/script.rpy	5734	"[what]"
puddle_fed4aafa	f	You're right. I'm sorry.	game/script.rpy	5735	f "[what]"
puddle_247394c8	f	I just...	game/script.rpy	5736	f "[what]"
puddle_f9a6c8b6	f	I wanted to go on an adventure.	game/script.rpy	5737	f "[what]"
puddle_b40988bc	f	I'll stay here, then. Don't want to get in your way.	game/script.rpy	5738	f "[what]"
puddle_beb349a3	f	But if you aren't out in ten minutes, I... I'll come in to rescue you. Alright?	game/script.rpy	5739	f "[what]"
puddle_b40cd7cf		You agreed.	game/script.rpy	5740	"[what]"
puddle_38946b87		Soon, you had crossed the river paths to the cottage in the centre.	game/script.rpy	5744	"[what]"
puddle_45b702f7		Up over the walls grew a riot of herbs and flowers of every type, rambling over everything and growing in a lush green-grass garden on the roof. 	game/script.rpy	5745	"[what]"
puddle_694585b8		The pig munched on some violets blooming from the windowsill.	game/script.rpy	5747	"[what]"
puddle_6be40cbb		You saw the glimmer of two red eyes watching you from a small crook in the roof. Then there was a gasp from inside, and they disappeared.	game/script.rpy	5748	"[what]"
puddle_a6b81705		The closer you got to the cottage, the more the toad shook with terror.	game/script.rpy	5750	"[what]"
puddle_65f650db	pov	You'd better stay behind. Guard the rear.	game/script.rpy	5751	pov "[what]"
puddle_4bd0df12	f	G-good idea.	game/script.rpy	5752	f "[what]"
puddle_94264887	f	But be wary, my friend. Few have ever left that cottage alive	game/script.rpy	5753	f "[what]"
puddle_287ce3b2	f	Witches have red eyes. They see very far, but they have a keen sense of smell, like animals, and can sense when humans are near them.	game/script.rpy	5754	f "[what]"
puddle_0f0e93d0	f	If you aren't out in ten minutes, I'll come in there to rescue you.	game/script.rpy	5755	f "[what]"
toadFinale_40b33880		You leapt to defend the toad, diving and pushing him away from the slashes of the crooked dagger.	game/script.rpy	5760	"[what]"

toadSolo_c78d97b4		With another click, a dozen beautiful frog maids escorted you to golden baths where all the dirt of the journey was washed away. The finest frog soprano choir in all the land serenaded you with tales of Brildebrogue Chippingham's latest exploits.	game/script.rpy	6396	"[what]"

toadSoloFinale_7e1eb1b3		He gave you a final wave. Then, he was swallowed up into the darkness.	game/script.rpy	6601	"[what]"

toadSoloFinale_fec08251		The barriers were set. The guards of silver, gold, lead, rowan, ash, oak, and the final layer of bone.	game/script.rpy	6603	"[what]"
toadSoloFinale_0c4aecac		A great silence settled upon the house.	game/script.rpy	6611	"[what]"

puddleSolo_62818470		The floor was covered in a network of flags and string in a grid pattern, each flag marked with a letter and number. You stepped over them gingerly to enter the room.	game/script.rpy	7519	"[what]"

witchExperiments_4854b131		The witch didn't seem to notice.	game/script.rpy	7544	"[what]"

witchExperiments_acf00d0b		The air was completely clear, and the cottage was well-lit.	game/script.rpy	7547	"[what]"
witchExperiments_acdcbd81		But still, for some reason you couldn't see more than five feet ahead of you.	game/script.rpy	7548	"[what]"
witchExperiments_1f05e6f0		You heard a scrabbling sound.	game/script.rpy	7550	"[what]"

witchExperiments_5fd8e849		Trying to get in.	game/script.rpy	7552	"[what]"
witchExperiments_e31b0316		You were having difficulty speaking. But you slowly walked forward and kept asking questions.	game/script.rpy	7553	"[what]"
witchExperiments_00171b94		You felt a deep pressure settle on you. Like being at the bottom of the ocean. Compressing your body from all angles. Your muscles knotted and twisted.	game/script.rpy	7555	"[what]"
witchExperiments_74fe3587		It was done.	game/script.rpy	7556	"[what]"

witchExperiments_322c9104		The witch gestured to the network of flags at her feet.	game/script.rpy	7578	"[what]"
witchExperiments_ca0e9b8d	w	This is what started everything.	game/script.rpy	7579	w "[what]"

witchExperiments_66976c91	w	It's shrinking. You see?	game/script.rpy	7584	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_d05ff6c7		She points at the grid of flags laid all across the cottage floor.	game/script.rpy	7585	"[what]"
witchExperiments_dcf49389	w	The flags start here.	game/script.rpy	7586	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_229c5bae		She pointed to the front left corner of the cottage, at a flag labelled "G-02".	game/script.rpy	7587	"[what]"
witchExperiments_df0be604	w	And they end here.	game/script.rpy	7588	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_cdc44c09		She points to the lower right corner of the house, at a flag labeled "Z-10".	game/script.rpy	7589	"[what]"
witchExperiments_fd2bd86e	w	But why would I do that? Why would I start the naming system at G-02, instead of A-01? How does that make sense as a numbering system?	game/script.rpy	7590	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_d64e2560	pov	It... doesn't.	game/script.rpy	7592	pov "[what]"
witchExperiments_e63fdc3b	w	Exactly.	game/script.rpy	7593	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_ac2ca41e	w	Here's my hypothesis. The initial numbering system began at A-01. Since then, the space has shrunk.	game/script.rpy	7594	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_76615cc5	w	That's why the system now begins at this flag here, "H-03."	game/script.rpy	7595	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_671aac6a		She pointed at the starting flag.	game/script.rpy	7596	"[what]"
witchExperiments_2e091adf	pov	But if the cottage was shrinking, we'd notice it.	game/script.rpy	7597	pov "[what]"
witchExperiments_b1e3ae77	w	Not necessarily. My theory is that there is some kind of pressure, or force, that is stopping us from noticing or remembering. I just couldn't prove it - until I hit on the fork hypothesis.	game/script.rpy	7598	w "[what]"

witchExperiments_902ec136		The witch took you over to her front window, which you could see was stuffed with a giant, knotted network of string.	game/script.rpy	7607	"[what]"
witchExperiments_7dbe6338		The string was labelled with all the letters of the alphabet. It stretched out through the window.	game/script.rpy	7608	"[what]"
witchExperiments_9f3e1c54		You looked outside and saw that it was tied onto dozens of forks stuck into the soil, all over her property.	game/script.rpy	7609	"[what]"

witchExperiments_f0aa4a54	w	I tried to figure out where it's coming from - what's causing it. I tested out time of day - no results there. Are some objects more likely to disappear than others? Again, no visible pattern there. 	game/script.rpy	7613	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_e864c83b	w	I had a breakthrough when I considered that it might be location based. Emanating from a particular point. The closer an object is to that point, the more likely it is to disappear. But I couldn't make any meaningful progress because I couldn't prove whether or not something had disappeared.	game/script.rpy	7614	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_636fb602		She held up a fork.	game/script.rpy	7617	"[what]"
witchExperiments_56d7d2fa	w	Say this fork vanished. And not only that, but it vanished so completely that you never remembered it existing at all. How could you prove that it ever existed?	game/script.rpy	7618	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_2f0b5bfe	w	How do you prove something used to exist, if that thing now does not exist, and never did?	game/script.rpy	7624	w "[what]" nointeract
witchExperiments_cf966a07	w	That's the scary part. Even my notes no longer mention the fork ever existing.	game/script.rpy	7627	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_32fefa38	w	Somehow even they have been re-written by the new, forkless reality.	game/script.rpy	7628	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_c516578a	w	No, I've only found one way to detect the change.	game/script.rpy	7629	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_cc95a1ba	w	Fantastic idea, but sadly impractical. I have consulted the Devil on this, of course.	game/script.rpy	7631	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_fbdb02b6	w	I suspect He knows more than he's letting on, but sadly His comments have been completely unscientific. Totally useless for an experiment like this.	game/script.rpy	7632	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_c516578a_1	w	No, I've only found one way to detect the change.	game/script.rpy	7633	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_7c57e5e3	pov	I... well...	game/script.rpy	7635	pov "[what]"
witchExperiments_7f90118d	pov	I don't think you can, can you?	game/script.rpy	7636	pov "[what]"
witchExperiments_f0443a78	w	String.	game/script.rpy	7638	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_b7cbc602		She reached up and quickly tugged at each piece of string in the window in turn. Most of them held firm. One of them showed no resistance when she tugged.	game/script.rpy	7639	"[what]"
witchExperiments_ca7c5330		She pulled that one through the window. It was a long, long piece and she rapidly wound it up until the end came through the window.	game/script.rpy	7640	"[what]"
witchExperiments_6e2ac586		The end was tied into a loop with nothing inside.	game/script.rpy	7641	"[what]"
witchExperiments_719d18c0	w	You see?	game/script.rpy	7642	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_7d346e3c	w	When an object vanishes, everything around it stays the same.	game/script.rpy	7643	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_0a05f176	w	So even though the fork is gone, the string remains.	game/script.rpy	7644	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_d389b9ec		She pronounced this last part with maniacal glee.	game/script.rpy	7645	"[what]"
witchExperiments_dd6f49f9	w	The phenomenon seems to be able to wipe objects from our memories, but it's not a perfect deletion. The physical signs that the object used to exist are still there.	game/script.rpy	7646	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_d15dd227	w	So when I pull back a piece of string that no longer has a fork in it, that means a fork must have been there, and it disappeared.	game/script.rpy	7647	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_f7a25e8f	w	From there it was simple. All I had to do is tie all my forks with pieces of string, and laying them out in a grid network, and record the location of each piece of string that doesn't have a fork in it. 	game/script.rpy	7648	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_faf09acf		She carefully placed the string next to a big row of other pieces of looped string. Then she pointed at the writing on her wall that said "I OWN TWENTY SEVEN FORKS."	game/script.rpy	7649	"[what]"
witchExperiments_6cb908be	w	This message says I own twenty seven forks. But I have thirteen forkless pieces of string. That means at least thirteen forks have disappeared since this experiment began.	game/script.rpy	7650	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_7f6552a9	w	The question then of course is, why has the message changed to fit the new forkless reality - yet the strings are left behind?	game/script.rpy	7651	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_a3024227	w	Does this anomaly have some kind of limited ability to warp language, specifically?	game/script.rpy	7652	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_10397690	w	It almost seems to suggest some kind of active sentience behind it. It notices some things, and changes them, but misses other things. Like it's been carelessly censored.	game/script.rpy	7653	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_50135aed		She whipped out her pencil and began recording a pattern of dots on her grid.	game/script.rpy	7654	"[what]"
witchExperiments_6c3435af		You noticed a place in the top left of the grid labelled "INCIDENT ZONE".	game/script.rpy	7655	"[what]"
witchExperiments_d96039c9	pov	So... where are the disappearances coming from?	game/script.rpy	7656	pov "[what]"
witchExperiments_7c4a93e2	pov	Is that what your grid shows?	game/script.rpy	7657	pov "[what]"
witchExperiments_21086076	w	That's why I was so glad to speak to you.	game/script.rpy	7658	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_eac8f6ec		She tapped the INCIDENT ZONE label.	game/script.rpy	7659	"[what]"
witchExperiments_455cbb46	w	It's your house.	game/script.rpy	7660	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_bf904c87	w	And it seems to be moving outward.	game/script.rpy	7661	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_b26797a7		You noticed a small closet in the back of the cottage, with a sign on the door said "Experiment Site 3".	game/script.rpy	7666	"[what]"
witchExperiments_226ca540	pov	What's that one?	game/script.rpy	7667	pov "[what]"
witchExperiments_f1d90117	w	Hmm?	game/script.rpy	7668	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_80d60fb0	w	Oh... I, uh...	game/script.rpy	7669	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_3e085dc0		She looked confused.	game/script.rpy	7670	"[what]"
witchExperiments_e5b3eede		You opened the closet and peered in carefully.	game/script.rpy	7671	"[what]"
witchExperiments_188ae484		Inside was a tiny set of gentlemen's clothes, carefully folded on a stool. Small enough for a rat to wear.	game/script.rpy	7672	"[what]"
witchExperiments_6c7ec6fd		A tiny top hat was placed on top of the pile, with a pair of miniature dress shoes next to it.	game/script.rpy	7673	"[what]"
witchExperiments_7f135446	pov	What is this?	game/script.rpy	7674	pov "[what]"
witchExperiments_275e7445		The longer you stared at tiny bundle of clothes, the more a sense of powerful and implicit wrongness crawled under your skin.	game/script.rpy	7675	"[what]"
witchExperiments_fcbf89d4		Something about them didn't fit. They didn't belong here.	game/script.rpy	7676	"[what]"
witchExperiments_400b272f	w	I don't remember this.	game/script.rpy	7677	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_858c949b		The closet was suffocating. There was barely room to breathe. You felt the urge to get out in the fresh air.	game/script.rpy	7678	"[what]"
witchExperiments_f332133d		You forced yourself to move closer to the clothes. You picked up one of the tiny dress shoes. The bottom was encrusted with mud.	game/script.rpy	7679	"[what]"
witchExperiments_714f817f	pov	They must be the clothes from... an old childhood toy you used to have.	game/script.rpy	7680	pov "[what]"
witchExperiments_849c2f86	pov	It's probably nothing.	game/script.rpy	7681	pov "[what]"
witchExperiments_d2397e50	w	Yes of course, that must be it.	game/script.rpy	7682	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_adff6eee	w	I remember now. Nothing at all. Just an old toy.	game/script.rpy	7683	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_d241bdb7		Dark spots swam at the corners of your vision. You dropped the shoe and staggered out of the closet.	game/script.rpy	7700	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_fc7e0645		You felt a strangling pressure in your throat.	game/script.rpy	7707	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_b4d9f745	w	Now that we know this Lacuna is coming from your house, we can -	game/script.rpy	7708	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_4ef597de		Your tongue was fat and poisonous in your mouth.	game/script.rpy	7709	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_b83f0d4f		It twisted, and spoke.	game/script.rpy	7710	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_ef45a91f	pov	This is an exciting theory, isn't it?	game/script.rpy	7711	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_02d30eca	pov	It makes you the hero. A visionary.	game/script.rpy	7712	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_51f3093b	pov	You saw what no-one else could, now only you can stop it, that sort of thing.	game/script.rpy	7713	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_1a90fb7a	pov	But I think you are overlooking a much simpler explanation.	game/script.rpy	7714	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_7dd42144	w	What do you mean?	game/script.rpy	7715	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_d8170736	pov	Memory loss. Confusion.	game/script.rpy	7716	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_a8c952ed	pov	Difficulty performing familiar tasks.	game/script.rpy	7717	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_aa0726ae	pov	Withdrawing from friends and family.	game/script.rpy	7718	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_29153407	pov	Losing the ability to think clearly.	game/script.rpy	7719	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_6a1ee191	pov	What do these symptoms suggest?	game/script.rpy	7720	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_c9e82a90	w	I-	game/script.rpy	7721	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_33b376e3	w	No. No, that's not possible.	game/script.rpy	7722	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_e611144f		Her voice was unsteady.	game/script.rpy	7723	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_c328612c	w	I- I know I have struggled in the past. But it's not just me. We proved it.	game/script.rpy	7724	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_9b9bbf62	w	It can't just be in my head. What about the strings?	game/script.rpy	7725	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_093bdec8	pov	What strings?	game/script.rpy	7726	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_1eb376ba		She turned around. There were no strings on the windowsill.	game/script.rpy	7727	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_f3c6394e		The floor of the cottage was clear. There were no flags.	game/script.rpy	7728	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_5c59a5ee		There never were.	game/script.rpy	7729	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_e7595979	w	That's - I can't - what about the forks?	game/script.rpy	7730	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_87afd897	pov	You're confused, dear. You don't own any forks.	game/script.rpy	7731	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_edbf97f1	pov	Don't you remember? You never have. 	game/script.rpy	7732	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_4a590cd6		The witch looked out the window and saw that you were right. The ground was bare. The cottage was empty. There were no forks in sight.	game/script.rpy	7733	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_08dc1047		Your throat pulsed and pushed the words out of your teeth.	game/script.rpy	7734	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_fe4b3eeb	pov	You eat with your hands. Your bare hands.	game/script.rpy	7735	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_349ff043	pov	Your claws. Your teeth.	game/script.rpy	7736	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_51efc0ee	pov	You always have. You told me so.	game/script.rpy	7737	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_4070d93e	w	No. No, I wouldn't do that. They have to be here.	game/script.rpy	7738	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_3d463873		The witch began to ransack the house, pulling out drawers and shelves, but there was nothing inside.	game/script.rpy	7739	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_1d6f1755		On the wall was a smeared message in bright red paint. It said "I OWN NOTHING."	game/script.rpy	7740	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_e7e964f6	pov	I'm worried about you, dear. We all are.	game/script.rpy	7741	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_6ec38e2d	pov	Staying all alone in this tiny, tiny cottage, all by yourself. It's barely enough room to fit.	game/script.rpy	7742	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_27377b79		The walls pressed in on you. You didn't even have space to stand fully upright.	game/script.rpy	7743	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_11f12ac5	pov	We've known each other for so long.	game/script.rpy	7744	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_8d47662a	w	We have?	game/script.rpy	7745	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_c30e55d4		You felt your throat muscles burn as they constricted in your throat. Your voice came out, sounding soft and comforting.	game/script.rpy	7746	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_d93502ab	pov	Of course. So many years now. We wouldn't lie to you. We only want you to be safe.	game/script.rpy	7747	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_f0b9861b	pov	You have to trust me. You're not well. These things you're seeing... they aren't there.	game/script.rpy	7748	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_0e080ca6		The witch spoke in a very small voice.	game/script.rpy	7749	"[what]"

witchSoloFinale_9f7889ce	w	Okay.	game/script.rpy	7751	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_1731d7c0	pov	This really is the best thing, dear. For your health.	game/script.rpy	7756	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_8dd8db88		She looked down at her hands. They were shaking. Tears welled up in her eyes, and you looked away courteously.	game/script.rpy	7757	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_94df3179	w	I was doing so well. I thought I was better.	game/script.rpy	7758	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_803208c8	w	I really, really thought...	game/script.rpy	7759	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_55f2f339		There was a long silence.	game/script.rpy	7760	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_4f784d08	w	Well. It doesn't matter now.	game/script.rpy	7761	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_4f9e45ca	w	I- I'll pack my things. I know you only want me to be safe.	game/script.rpy	7762	w "[what]"

witchSoloFinale_ad019b02	pov	Don't worry. Everything is going to be fine.	game/script.rpy	7764	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_b252640e	pov	I'll get the villagers, and we'll come back for you and your things.	game/script.rpy	7765	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_dad7e88a	pov	We can set you up in the village somewhere safe. Where you aren't a danger to yourself.	game/script.rpy	7766	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_5451fbbe		Your muscles clenched, and pulled you upright.	game/script.rpy	7767	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_c431f06c		The witch's face was scrunched up and she was rubbing her eyes.	game/script.rpy	7768	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_494b8332	w	Thank you. I'm sorry.	game/script.rpy	7769	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_afe7d86f	pov	There's no need to be sorry. I forgive you.	game/script.rpy	7770	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_d3d99841		She looked at you. Her eyes were large and terrified.	game/script.rpy	7771	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_90b389e9	w	Y-you'll come back for me, right?	game/script.rpy	7772	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_0d23b7dc	pov	Of course. I'll be right back.	game/script.rpy	7773	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_84fb2c88	w	I'm sorry.	game/script.rpy	7774	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_1223ad81		Your muscles constricted, and your legs jerked. Your arms pulled you through the miniature doorway and out of the witch's house.	game/script.rpy	7775	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_fa9e685b		You saw the witch once in the doorway, looking scared and alone in the crushingly small space of her tiny, tiny cottage.	game/script.rpy	7776	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_8efd3315		Then the door closed, and your body turned around.	game/script.rpy	7778	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_667a99b2		You felt the tension leave you, like surfacing from the bottom of the ocean. You bent over and hacked some twisted, bloody thing out of from inside you and onto the grass.	game/script.rpy	7786	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_a23c5fcf		It looked like a matted clump of dark fur. You glanced at it once, then looked away and forgot it forever.	game/script.rpy	7787	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_0b730016		The night was cool and quiet. There was a lovely breeze blowing.	game/script.rpy	7788	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_330d7041		You were in the middle of a large, empty field. The stars twinkled above you. The grass crunched under your feet. Nothing beside remained.	game/script.rpy	7789	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_d35fc71b		Why did you come out here?	game/script.rpy	7790	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_72b6e4bf		You couldn't recall. There was no-one living out this way.	game/script.rpy	7791	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_cf9ff944		Never has been.	game/script.rpy	7792	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_3b87a192		You shook your head and laughed at your own foolishness. You must have gotten lost again. You've been so forgetful lately.	game/script.rpy	7793	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_3cd062c8		But no matter. It was a beautiful night. Perfect for a walk.	game/script.rpy	7794	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_bf3d8c26		You stretched your legs, and began the long walk back to the village and home.	game/script.rpy	7795	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_1faae478		Far away, a small piece of string with a loop in it fell into the river, and was gone.	game/script.rpy	7796	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_1978ad81		There is nothing else to say. The tale is told.	game/script.rpy	7797	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_e5506e9f		If you like it, praise it.	game/script.rpy	7798	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_91f8d401		If not, let it be forgotten.	game/script.rpy	7800	"[what]"
toadWitchInvestigate_213d021c		The woods were quiet.	game/script.rpy	7811	"[what]"
toadWitchInvestigate_389e78d2		You walked through the woods for long hours. Eventually, you came to a clearing. You looked up.	game/script.rpy	7829	"[what]"
toadWitchInvestigate_d0a105b5		The Firmament was gazing down upon you.	game/script.rpy	7832	"[what]"

thiefMushroomInvestigate_4e8b1e81		The lights and warmth welcomed you back.	game/script.rpy	7906	"[what]"
toadInvestigate_6eb6bb95		You walked along the side of the river. The water was still and deep. There was a small, muddy hole on the edge of the riverbank.	game/script.rpy	7912	"[what]"
toadInvestigate_4e3d5c9e		You crouched down and slithered into the hole. Mud covered you.	game/script.rpy	7919	"[what]"

wolfNameEnd_927877ab		It's everything you've ever dreamed of.	game/script.rpy	9217	"[what]"
wolfNameEnd_86ec3ed0		Yes. Thank you.	game/script.rpy	9221	"[what]"
wolfNameEnd_0f5f7497		I have spent my life honouring the old ways. Preserving the old kind of evil.	game/script.rpy	9222	"[what]"
wolfNameEnd_28c7dc51		Beautiful and terrible. Mystery and horror. Ruthless, captivating. A dark fire.	game/script.rpy	9223	"[what]"
wolfNameEnd_e2193b26		That type of evil doesn't exist in your world.	game/script.rpy	9224	"[what]"
wolfNameEnd_ff12a4c0		The evil in your world is a grey, endless fog that soaks into every particle of your being like mould.	game/script.rpy	9225	"[what]"
wolfNameEnd_81dec319		You can't even see it. Like a fish can't see water. It surrounds you. Every day you wake up and breathe it in.	game/script.rpy	9226	"[what]"
wolfNameEnd_4e6e4d77		It has been built into every fibre of the human machine.	game/script.rpy	9227	"[what]"
wolfNameEnd_90f09934		No one human can stop it. You can't even understand the scope of it.	game/script.rpy	9228	"[what]"
wolfNameEnd_2b411413		I offer you a better evil.	game/script.rpy	9229	"[what]"

wolfNameEnd_8376baa1		I don't think you understand.	game/script.rpy	9245	"[what]"
wolfNameEnd_de6925cb		We have grown weak, in here. The souls have all run dry.	game/script.rpy	9246	"[what]"
wolfNameEnd_76d78685		I am dying. Without a new soul, this story and all within it will wither to nothing, and disappear.	game/script.rpy	9247	"[what]"
wolfNameEnd_bb7bfabc		There are only two paths ahead of you now.	game/script.rpy	9248	"[what]"
wolfNameEnd_4be6f370		You can burn the book, destroying me and all within it, and free yourself.	game/script.rpy	9249	"[what]"
wolfNameEnd_74c6f192		Or you can give yourself up, and live here in happiness for all your days.	game/script.rpy	9250	"[what]"
wolfNameEnd_a577d893		Listen. Do not destroy this story lightly.	game/script.rpy	9251	"[what]"
wolfNameEnd_2f9ff93c		The terror was great, but the dream was marvellous.	game/script.rpy	9252	"[what]"
wolfNameEnd_5d97fbfa		We must treasure the dream, no matter the terror.	game/script.rpy	9253	"[what]"
wolfNameEnd_29390382		Very well. I see you've made your choice.	game/script.rpy	9256	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_16b8cb94		Silence.	game/script.rpy	9263	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_461b7a49		It oozed out of the gaps in the rotten floorboards and the cracks in the windows and down through the small holes in the roof.	game/script.rpy	9264	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_09a6e0b7		It had been lying in wait there for all those long years, and it could wait no longer.	game/script.rpy	9265	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_828047e3		It had finally won.	game/script.rpy	9266	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_3f5d4e12		You sat alone in your silent corroding house in an empty forest that had no name.	game/script.rpy	9267	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_4ec97ac2		Every day, you barred the windows and stopped up the cracks with plaster and kept your door locked and barred against the vacuum of the corpse-world outside.	game/script.rpy	9268	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_1c8e22f2		But still it came, seeping in through the crevices of your home in a great slow flood, pressing in with such force you could barely breathe.	game/script.rpy	9269	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_8a64c158		The silence was in everything. It penetrated your meat and your bones and soaked deep into your brain. There were great empty silent spaces in your thoughts. Things you were no longer able to think.	game/script.rpy	9270	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_511be69d		You had lived in this house for as long as you could remember, which was three days.	game/script.rpy	9271	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_beb416e8		There were many beds for you to sleep on. The pantry was fully stocked with food for you to eat. In the closets, you found many outfits to wear, of all shapes and sizes. The shelf in the hall held 13 pairs of shoes, from small to large.	game/script.rpy	9272	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_42b6e43b		Where did it all come from? Who made the food? Who built the beds? These questions no longer had meaning for you.	game/script.rpy	9273	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_1a4660de		Whenever you were troubled by such things, you simply shrugged and said:	game/script.rpy	9274	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_97b69347	pov	The House provides.	game/script.rpy	9275	pov "[what]"
allVanishedEnd_9370f9e1		Was there ever anything outside this room, and this house? None can say.	game/script.rpy	9276	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_4df4ed67		Did you ever have a name? None can say.	game/script.rpy	9277	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_2660193d		You ate from the pantry of the house, and slept on the beds of the house, and wore the clothes of the house. That is all.	game/script.rpy	9278	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_97b69347_1	pov	The House provides.	game/script.rpy	9279	pov "[what]"
allVanishedEnd_c40f611f		Like all other things, your house slowly fell day by day into greater and greater ruin as the unstoppable and silent force of entropy ground it into the dirt, piece by piece.	game/script.rpy	9280	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_e14dffa6		Soon the Lacuna would be total and all-encompassing. Nothing would be left.	game/script.rpy	9281	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_109b3cce		By that time, of course, you would be long dead.	game/script.rpy	9283	"[what]"
silence_9f0cf8e7		You watched the soft glow of the dying coals.	game/script.rpy	9299	"[what]"
silence_544d6993		A memory came to you. You remembered how anxious you used to be.	game/script.rpy	9300	"[what]"
silence_d44698f9		So much grief and fear and pain over this dying earth of yours, and now it was done.	game/script.rpy	9301	"[what]"
silence_8b59eaf9		There was nothing to fear anymore. The worst had already come to pass.	game/script.rpy	9302	"[what]"
silence_9ca5e71d		A great wash of relief came over you. The weight of the world lifted from your shoulders.	game/script.rpy	9303	"[what]"
silence_2381971d		You were at peace.	game/script.rpy	9304	"[what]"
silence_6ce28b74		Too late to do anything about it now. Too late for anything.	game/script.rpy	9305	"[what]"
silence_a034cbfd		You had never dared explore the lands outside the house. One day, you decided to try.	game/script.rpy	9320	"[what]"
silence_0768f61b		You searched the house and found a midnight cloak and a black mask. In the pockets were small precious gems and soft, mossy stones.	game/script.rpy	9322	"[what]"
silence_083bd7ea		You searched the house and found a black hat with a wide brim and a pointed crown. Nearby was a warm cloak with parcels of herbs and tea in the pockets.	game/script.rpy	9324	"[what]"
silence_30fc1620		You searched the house and found a tiny suit, top hat and cane. In the pockets you discovered parcels of food and a small decanter of pond scum.	game/script.rpy	9326	"[what]"
silence_2fc928cc		You searched the house. Deep in the rich dark soil of the basement, you discovered packages of fine food - mushroom risotto and crisp goose roasted in truffle butter and dark red wine and platters of mushroom bourguignon with roast potatoes.	game/script.rpy	9329	"[what]"
silence_17a423b2		These things belonged to no-one.	game/script.rpy	9330	"[what]"
silence_79d71725	pov	The house provides.	game/script.rpy	9331	pov "[what]"
silence_67881317		You gathered them up and reached for the door, but as you took hold of the handle you stopped.	game/script.rpy	9332	"[what]"
silence_64811c7f		You could feel it outside.	game/script.rpy	9333	"[what]"
silence_ec10eddf		The howling pressure of the vacuum beyond pressed against the door like a physical force.	game/script.rpy	9334	"[what]"
silence_c9af5442		The weight of it paralysed you. You could not stand the thought of walking down the desolate path to that silent village where no-one lived.	game/script.rpy	9335	"[what]"
silence_bbcec664		As you gripped the doorknob, you had a vision of hundreds of vacant cars on empty bitumen roads, and yawning blank units sunk into the giant carcass of labyrinthine apartment blocks, and the infinite concrete abyss of shopping centers and plazas and petrol stations and office buildings, and carefully manicured dead lawns stretching on for endless acres, and underneath it all a cavernous cyclopean pit of parking lots that took up the whole underbelly of this hollow earth.	game/script.rpy	9337	"[what]"
silence_d5e54b3f		You fell away from the door, shaking.	game/script.rpy	9338	"[what]"
silence_f166b8ed		Better to sit in front of your fire. To keep the silence at bay for a while longer.	game/script.rpy	9339	"[what]"
silence_764fcd2e		You rested in that house for an uncountable time.	game/script.rpy	9342	"[what]"
silence_e1195eb9		Time, of course, had lost all meaning at this point.	game/script.rpy	9343	"[what]"
silence_1478c0da		All those petty, meaningless little things you needed to do had either been done already, or could never be done.	game/script.rpy	9344	"[what]"
silence_bc8e0d55		Either way, it was finished.	game/script.rpy	9345	"[what]"
silence_58150fff		I sat and rested there with you.	game/script.rpy	9346	"[what]"
silence_f3166b5c		My work, too, was done.	game/script.rpy	9347	"[what]"
silence_3ec8d061		There was rest in the land.	game/script.rpy	9348	"[what]"
silence_aca6d7f9		The fire was warm.	game/script.rpy	9349	"[what]"
silence_8c11d82c		Nothing left but to lie before the fire for a while, and wait.	game/script.rpy	9350	"[what]"

silence_0e0c9775		Yes. The house provides.	game/script.rpy	9352	"[what]"
wolfSilence_4aeb10e5		It doesn't matter.	game/script.rpy	9360	"[what]"
wolfSilence_61c31d79		My name was important a long, long time ago. But you wouldn't recognise it now.	game/script.rpy	9362	"[what]"
wolfSilence_45a93598		I came from an old story. The gods assigned me as a terror to the human race.	game/script.rpy	9363	"[what]"
wolfSilence_dcded923		I was possessed of seven horrors (or in your tongue you may say "Auras" or "Glamours of terrible splendour") which lay upon me like seven cloaks.	game/script.rpy	9364	"[what]"
wolfSilence_ac95a19c		My face was a single coiling line, like the entrails of men and beasts, from which omens can be read.	game/script.rpy	9365	"[what]"
wolfSilence_e038425e		I never knew a mother or father. I was born of the mountain.	game/script.rpy	9366	"[what]"
wolfSilence_72289d70		I guarded the forests. My breath was fire. My gaze was death. Who would dare stand against me?	game/script.rpy	9367	"[what]"
wolfSilence_05c03743		Long time ago now.	game/script.rpy	9368	"[what]"
wolfSilence_c6cf1690		Barely remember those days. No-one does.	game/script.rpy	9369	"[what]"
wolfSilence_b62a033b		Fragments of me survived. I clung to life in old stories like this one.	game/script.rpy	9372	"[what]"
wolfSilence_64e91d80		The beast in the forest. The wolf at the door.	game/script.rpy	9373	"[what]"
wolfSilence_afab1c78		You know.	game/script.rpy	9374	"[what]"
wolfSilence_6ac1e004		I'm sorry, child. You had the misfortune of coming in at the end of things.	game/script.rpy	9378	"[what]"
wolfSilence_b0e31330		Each of them read my book, and struck a bargain with me. To live here, in this story, in the life of their dreams.	game/script.rpy	9379	"[what]"
wolfSilence_dbb56662		Do not think I was unkind. I kept my deal. Each of them lived here for a hundred years or more.	game/script.rpy	9380	"[what]"
wolfSilence_0bc7d7c5		But nothing lasts forever.	game/script.rpy	9381	"[what]"
wolfSilence_937b1c6e		They are forgotten now. As both of us soon will be.	game/script.rpy	9382	"[what]"
wolfSilence_1df910f9		This is the curse you have been born with. To witness the end.	game/script.rpy	9383	"[what]"
wolfSilence_7a310a7b		It had to happen to someone.	game/script.rpy	9384	"[what]"
wolfSilence_1057a9f4		No, child. There was no trick.	game/script.rpy	9388	"[what]"
wolfSilence_a54dce8e		Here, in my story, they got the life they always wanted to live.	game/script.rpy	9389	"[what]"
wolfSilence_7ed26a21		Wise, brave, cunning and kind. The best version of themselves.	game/script.rpy	9390	"[what]"
wolfSilence_978addb2		Real life, of course, was never so kind.	game/script.rpy	9391	"[what]"
wolfSilence_f71922ce		The world they were born into was not a good place for them.	game/script.rpy	9393	"[what]"
wolfSilence_54ec86f2		As I suspect it is not a good place for you.	game/script.rpy	9394	"[what]"
wolfSilence_0d0d936b		I offered them another world.	game/script.rpy	9395	"[what]"
wolfSilence_afe42cc1		Of course, in time, they would disappear. Nothing lasts forever. They knew that when they took the deal. 	game/script.rpy	9396	"[what]"
wolfSilence_6b263407		Yes, child.	game/script.rpy	9400	"[what]"
wolfSilence_f623b0df		Every one of us is eaten in the end.	game/script.rpy	9401	"[what]"
