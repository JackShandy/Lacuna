introMenu_11f95f46		In fact the whole earth was overrun with trolls, hob-and-lanthorns, gringes, cutties and nisses, boguests, bonelesses, boggleboes, black-bugs and night-bats, clabbernappers, corpse lights, candles and Gabriel-hounds, mawkins, hodge-pochers, korreds, lubberkins, cluricauns, hob-thrushes, tod-lowries, Jack-in-the-Wads, men-in-the-oak, dudmen, yeth-hounds, mormos, changelings, redcaps, colt-pixies, Tom-thumbs, madcaps, scrags, spectres, scar-bugs, shag-foals, Jinny-burnt-tails, dopple-gangers, and apparitions of every shape, make, form, and fashion.	game/script.rpy	2138	"[what]"

introMenu_be73521b		But still, sometimes you would get a hollow feeling inside you, and walk out of the house to stare into the dark woods beyond.	game/script.rpy	2148	"[what]"
introMenu_0891572a		No matter how many people were around you, you felt like something was missing.	game/script.rpy	2149	"[what]"

introMenu_c06a4f2d		As you lay awake in bed at night, you felt the silence.	game/script.rpy	2168	"[what]"
introMenu_6192752c		It lurked behind everything. Like a shadow on the wall of something that you dared not turn around to see.	game/script.rpy	2169	"[what]"
introMenu_7850b3e8		You found yourself leaving the taps going, the fire roaring, keeping the pots and pans rattling just to shut it out. Just so you couldn't hear what lay behind the sound.	game/script.rpy	2170	"[what]"
introMenu_8566e63a		Soon you could stand it no longer. You knew there would be a festival in town tonight (although you could not have said how you knew this).	game/script.rpy	2179	"[what]"

mushroomIntro_857662e0		And the distant echo of some soft sound.	game/script.rpy	2268	"[what]"
mushroomIntro_ce9f1473		It almost sounded like scratching. In the walls of the chamber.	game/script.rpy	2269	"[what]"
mushroomIntro_299a1869		All at once you remembered the festival, and your godparent, and the promise you made to your mother. This was no time to be dallying about exploring caverns! You had to find a way to escape your fate before midnight.	game/script.rpy	2270	"[what]"

At my words, He shrank back with a most timiditous cowardice, and I saw Him gulp in nervous anxiety most profound, such was His fear of my fury (which can be quite considerable when my dander is up, although of course I take care to remain in good humour for the purpose of conversing with polite gentlefolk such as yourself). In an instant, He swore never to do evil again, and scurried away over hill and dale without a backwards glance.	game/script.rpy	2803	f "[what]"

Release her at once, or I'll have to get extremely unpleasant with you (And you do NOT wish to see me when I'm being unpleasant, I assure you (Such a thing has driven many hard men to tears!))

toadAccept_9f10bb7c	f	Why just the other day I travelled to the living city of Brilochiorp, built on a turtle's back, where your dreams cast shadows and your thoughts chase after you in the mid-afternoon sun. I was there to discuss matters with the queen of the dream thieves, you see, a rascally beggar who had been running about the city filching this dream and that right out of the heads of the poor citizens, so that they dreamed nothing and had no ideas and the city's art and culture stagnated to nothing! Well, we can't have this sort of thing going on, Brilebrogue, I said to myself, and so I paid the blighter a visit and gave her a stern talking-to, and no mistake. She renounced his ways in an instant and placed all the dreams back exactly where he found them, promising to reform her ways and be a better woman.

Can I trust you with a most powerful and deadly secret, such that it would destroy the heavens if it were to be released? Of course I gave him my assurances immediately, and thus he told me that the devil's seven daughters were locked below the city in chains, and could only be released with the most secret and magical word, "Grolabicon"! Of course if this were ever to be discovered and the daughters released, they would wreak such terrible havoc on the world as to bring the Firmament crashing down from Her place up above, and it would be the seventh and final apocalypse come at last, which is why I gave him my word that I would keep the secret safe as houses, and I have never told anyone of the matter to this day.	game/script.rpy	2831	f "[what]"

goblinTrain_cdf8b1e9		Your pig nestled into the chair beside you and began to chat to the nearby goblins in the language of mud.	game/script.rpy	4680	"[what]"
goblinTrain_d745715f		A team of goblins hung off the back of the train and picked up the tracks behind it, then climbed around to hand the tracks to the goblins at the front, who laid them in front of the train as it squeezed through the trees of the forest.	game/script.rpy	4686	"[what]"
goblinTrain_d4e11551		The goblins poured you dozens of goblin brews, bubbling ales and steaming warm ciders, goblin wines that oozed with red fog and goblin brandies that froze and melted and froze again as you drank them.	game/script.rpy	4692	"[what]"

goblinTrain_75fb7cf2		The thief smiled awkwardly. But for some reason, they didn't seem to share in the good mood. The smile quickly slid off their face, and they made an excuse to leave the party.	game/script.rpy	4718	"[what]"
goblinTrain2_1c16af2f		The goblins laughed and cheered and served goblin fruits and carved goblin hams made of rich mould and mud and played goblin games all across the table.	game/script.rpy	4728	"[what]"
goblinTrain2_8bc07250		Your pig was quickly drawn into a wager, with it's greatest hopes and dreams as the stakes. Fortunately it won, and was granted a small kingdom in the mountains as it's prize.

mushroomDisappears_3ef4e5d8		She pulled out a bottle of wine and uncorked it.	game/script.rpy	5159	"[what]"
mushroomDisappears_fd10c8ca		As she did so, there was a sound from outside. Like the howling of the wind.	game/script.rpy	5160	"[what]"
mushroomDisappears_55b8cc6c	m4	Oh no. No.	game/script.rpy	5161	m4 "[what]"
mushroomDisappears_99575c18		She looked around. There was no treasure. The floor was bare.	game/script.rpy	5163	"[what]"
mushroomDisappears_925f98cf		It always had been.	game/script.rpy	5164	"[what]"
mushroomDisappears_b73d8ad2	m	We'll have to run. Come on-	game/script.rpy	5165	m "[what]"
mushroomDisappears_51728611		But as she looked around for her sisters, she realised she was alone.	game/script.rpy	5166	"[what]"
mushroomDisappears_79c61455		There was only one mushroom there. Standing alone, in the centre of an empty room.	game/script.rpy	5167	"[what]"
mushroomDisappears_67ac72e8		There had never been anything more.	game/script.rpy	5168	"[what]"

mushroomDisappears_a30759af		That's the way it's always been.	game/script.rpy	5184	"[what]"

mushroomDisappears_ca866848		But there were no walls.	game/script.rpy	5186	"[what]"
mushroomDisappears_812181f8		There were no doors. There were no windows. There was no floor.	game/script.rpy	5187	"[what]"
mushroomDisappears_1afe8e46		There was no air. There was no light. There was no space.	game/script.rpy	5188	"[what]"
mushroomDisappears_d8d1464d		And then there was nothing at all.	game/script.rpy	5196	"[what]"
mushroomDisappears_84b5a8f0		Nothing but a bottle of wine, that fell through the emptiness and smashed into pieces.	game/script.rpy	5197	"[what]"
mushroomDisappears_b65b5631		It was never seen or heard from again.	game/script.rpy	5199	"[what]"
thiefSolo_8e71b353		A thousand goblin shapes writhed up out of the train to hold up the thief in celebration, and you heard a cheer rise up from a thousand goblin throats.	game/script.rpy	5209	"[what]"
thiefSolo_0a465d83		Some had the heads of bats, some had the paws of cats, six heads, three heads, five arms, ten tails, and they bristled with tails and wings and fur and scales.	game/script.rpy	5210	"[what]"
thiefSolo_5def37d6		One crawled like a snail, one prowled like a wombat, one looked like seven doves tied together with string. All of them had a chaos of forms the likes of which you had never seen.	game/script.rpy	5211	"[what]"
thiefSolo_9e56f357		A dozen hands clapped you on the back and drew you into the train carriage.	game/script.rpy	5212	"[what]"

thiefSolo_4d8ed7f3	goblin3	To steal... from...	game/script.rpy	5216	goblin3 "[what]"
thiefSolo_3197e632		A vague and desperate confusion settled on the goblins face.	game/script.rpy	5217	"[what]"
thiefSolo_dd7f73c2	t	Barkeep! Drinks for everyone, on me!	game/script.rpy	5218	t "[what]"
thiefSolo_2c4a5f0f		The confusion cleared as the goblins all joined together in a roar of approval.	game/script.rpy	5219	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_332c8036		You fell into a chair and looked around.	game/script.rpy	5230	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_6c685cc3		This part of the train was some kind of bar or gambling hall. Looking up through a maze of trapdoors in the roof, you could see there were many floors stacked above this one. Bathhouses, gardens, workshops and observatories.	game/script.rpy	5233	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_cdf8b1e9		Your pig nestled into the chair beside you and began to chat to the nearby goblins in the language of mud.	game/script.rpy	5235	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_9cd18470		The thief whirled through the room - juggling, twisting, dancing, the life of the party.	game/script.rpy	5236	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_0002190c		Something was wrong with the inside of the carriage. You couldn't put your finger on it.	game/script.rpy	5237	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_7b3fcc27		Something you couldn't see. In your blind spot.	game/script.rpy	5238	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_d745715f		A team of goblins hung off the back of the train and picked up the tracks behind it, then climbed around to hand the tracks to the goblins at the front, who laid them in front of the train as it squeezed through the trees of the forest.	game/script.rpy	5244	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_7da01306		The wind howled like a wild beast.	game/script.rpy	5245	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_46d55367	t	Let's get some music going!	game/script.rpy	5246	t "[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_19e0f22d		The goblin band struck up a wild tune. The thief gestured to push them to play louder and louder until you couldn't even hear the wind outside.	game/script.rpy	5249	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_93bd1081		You felt your vision warping, for some reason you couldn't define. Like staring into a magic eye puzzle.	game/script.rpy	5250	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_d4e11551		The goblins poured you dozens of goblin brews, bubbling ales and steaming warm ciders, goblin wines that oozed with red fog and goblin brandies that froze and melted and froze again as you drank them.	game/script.rpy	5256	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_53e314f0		The thief challenged the largest goblin to a drinking competition and drank them under the table.	game/script.rpy	5257	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_634dc700		Foolishly, you drank deeply of the brews. You guzzled them down until you could drink no more, until your vision was a haze and the brew ran down your mouth and drenched your clothes, and still you thirsted for them.	game/script.rpy	5258	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_05c96d8c		From that day on, no other drink would ever be able to quench your thirst, and you would always shiver and feel cold without the wild drunken feeling of warmth the goblin drinks gave you.	game/script.rpy	5259	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_8b0a6fbf		You managed to corner the thief as they laughed in a group of goblins.	game/script.rpy	5263	"[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_01d81847	pov	Why did you grab me and take me here?	game/script.rpy	5264	pov "[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_7405edb5	t	It is my nature! Nothing more.	game/script.rpy	5265	t "[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_6c702751	t	I am the greatest thief of my generation. I was raised by these goblins to steal the moon and sun and stars, and now I have stolen you away.	game/script.rpy	5266	t "[what]"
thiefSoloMenu_f579cd87		They laughed wildly. Their face was slick with sweat.	game/script.rpy	5267	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_95593600	t	Nothing at all!	game/script.rpy	5281	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_d940ed94		They wiped the sweat from their forehead and gave you a charming smile. Their fingers were twisting and twitching rapidly, like they couldn't keep still.	game/script.rpy	5282	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_296e70fe	t	Everything is as it should be. In fact, this is the best it's ever been. Come, let us dance!	game/script.rpy	5283	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_48f4ee12		They took your hand in a dance that spiralled out of control. The music was deafening. The goblin faces whirled around you until you were breathless.	game/script.rpy	5284	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_f392e4d5	t	Nonsense! There's so much joy to be had here. Stay, and celebrate with us.	game/script.rpy	5292	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_3cda9500		Their smile slipped for an instant.	game/script.rpy	5293	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_05c8eabf	t	Please stay.	game/script.rpy	5294	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_ac39a7d0	t	 I don't want to be alone when it comes.	game/script.rpy	5295	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_af237791		Then it reappeared like nothing had happened. They drank deeply of their goblin wine and gestured for you to do the same.	game/script.rpy	5296	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_7ff669f0	t	Bedlam! I think a celebration like this calls for some smoke.	game/script.rpy	5297	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_bd072e07		A goblin creature shaped like a sack full of rats nodded, and started throwing herbs into the fire.	game/script.rpy	5298	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_b2ae0f06		Purple, twinkling smoke began to ooze out of it. As you breathed it in, your vision twisted and your limbs began to feel far away.	game/script.rpy	5299	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_7344494d		The thief twisted away from you, but you managed to track them down at the dice tables. The mass of goblins seethed around you.	game/script.rpy	5308	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_79b4ab87	pov	I need you to tell me what's going on.	game/script.rpy	5309	pov "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_61dd1907	pov	I feel it. Something is missing.	game/script.rpy	5310	pov "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_a4fb507e	pov	I don't know how to explain it, but I feel... more alone. More than I've ever been before.	game/script.rpy	5311	pov "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_ae403ca4	t	Don't worry about them, my friend. They made their choice. We all did!	game/script.rpy	5312	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo_63711814		They rolled the dice and raised their hands in triumph. The goblins around the table groaned and pushed a stack of rocks over to them.	game/script.rpy	5313	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_ab89a165		The music stopped. You looked around to see that the carriage was empty around you.	game/script.rpy	5323	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_fe9369ec		It had always been empty.	game/script.rpy	5324	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_f97cff5d	t	I don't think this train is going fast enough, haha!	game/script.rpy	5325	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_e1da650b		Juggling spoons with their right hand, they grabbed you and pulled you through the empty carriage towards the engine room.	game/script.rpy	5326	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_2ad1e5ef		You burst out of the carriage door and into the cool night air. Without the sound of the music, you could hear the wind howling like a banshee.	game/script.rpy	5329	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_9f2d06af		The thief pulled you through and into the engine room, where four sooty goblins were lounging.	game/script.rpy	5333	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_534064ec	t	Stoke the engine, will you? Let's see how fast this thing can move!	game/script.rpy	5334	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_bc689e0a	goblin4	Aye, boss!	game/script.rpy	5335	goblin4 "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_67e50aa7		The three goblins grabbed their shovels and set to work piling coal into the engine. The heat was intense.	game/script.rpy	5336	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_3ca1c0ea		You looked out the window. It was pitch black outside.	game/script.rpy	5339	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_031d5b44		The train moved faster and faster, and you could hear sparks coming off the wheels.	game/script.rpy	5346	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_6c5bb805		Your thoughts were jumbled and fractured.	game/script.rpy	5347	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_c9d12d6f		You heard something. Like claws, scrabbling in the mechanism underneath the carriage.	game/script.rpy	5356	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_2ee4dccf	pov	Do you hear-	game/script.rpy	5359	pov "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_51602938	t	Nothing to worry about! Just the wind!	game/script.rpy	5360	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_2742d0c9	t	Help me shovel this coal, will you?	game/script.rpy	5361	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_49b213d7		You looked around. The engine room was empty, except for you and the thief.	game/script.rpy	5362	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_388681bf		You picked up a shovel and held it.	game/script.rpy	5363	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_bc57beec	pov	Listen. I'll help you shovel if you tell me what's happening here.	game/script.rpy	5364	pov "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_75b23826		You could feel the confusion blooming in your brain. Expanding blank spaces like tumours.	game/script.rpy	5365	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_dcb64f28	pov	What's happening to me? To us? What... is this?	game/script.rpy	5366	pov "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_53764426		The thief sighed.	game/script.rpy	5367	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_6715f7e8	t	Alright. Just, please - help me shovel.	game/script.rpy	5368	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_1e08f047		You both began to shove coal into the furnace. The fire flared and the room grew hotter and hotter as the train sped up.	game/script.rpy	5369	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_233e8287		The thief looked into the flames.	game/script.rpy	5370	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_d23813a0	t	I made a deal. A long time ago.	game/script.rpy	5371	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_c6c7bdbf	t	We all took it. You will, too, in the end.	game/script.rpy	5372	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_96f600f5	t	Today, my debt is due. It's the end of the line.	game/script.rpy	5373	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_9846193f		The flames reflected in their dark eyes.	game/script.rpy	5374	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_b2d694ea	t	Ah, well.	game/script.rpy	5375	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_4acd6619	t	Everyone gets eaten by something. Might as well be this.	game/script.rpy	5376	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_25652915		The train screeched as it rounded a tight bend, sending you both stumbling.	game/script.rpy	5377	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_e607e68d	t	I think that's as fast as it'll go.	game/script.rpy	5378	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_d62fbf88	t	Come on. Let's spend the last moment in the moonlight.	game/script.rpy	5379	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_9388a762		They took your hand, and in a single twist of their long, long arms they pulled you both out of the engine and up onto the roof of the train.	game/script.rpy	5382	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_02d4ce07		You looked out across the night landscape. The land was haunted and beautiful. The smoke stung your eyes.	game/script.rpy	5383	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_675ac6c0	t	Here. I still have this.	game/script.rpy	5384	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_0ba2692b		They waved an ornate bottle of champagne at you.	game/script.rpy	5385	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_1de2cfc3	t	From my father's cellar. One of the first things I ever stole. I was saving it for a special occasion.	game/script.rpy	5386	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_51fe7993		They popped the cork.	game/script.rpy	5387	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_033cb47c	t	Don't worry. It's not goblin drink.	game/script.rpy	5388	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_3d16de59		They offered you a swig from the bottle as the train hurtled forward, teetering off the rails.	game/script.rpy	5389	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_2c4c1e82		You could hear something in the darkness behind you. Like the thudding of great paws.	game/script.rpy	5391	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_d54f7ee9	t	I had to do it.	game/script.rpy	5393	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_a4a48af3	t	Imagine a culture built around a black hole.	game/script.rpy	5394	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_0600b2a6	t	A tree with nothing at the root.	game/script.rpy	5395	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_66454648	t	The real world holds nothing for us. All we can do is extract as much joy as we can from each single day.	game/script.rpy	5397	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_451943e6	t	Until we finally take the westward line.	game/script.rpy	5398	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_e77aeba7		They took a swig from the champagne bottle.	game/script.rpy	5399	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_3b5d9fad		The howling wind abated for a single moment. The air was clear. The moon emerged from the clouds.	game/script.rpy	5403	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_649d12d9		The thief leaned off the train, holding onto the smoke stack with one hand and the champagne bottle with the other.	game/script.rpy	5404	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_0aade1ed	t	Well. This is it.	game/script.rpy	5405	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_c27940e5		You looked at their face. It was fierce with exaltation. A ferocious laugh split their mouth.	game/script.rpy	5406	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_76a25d97	t	I did it.	game/script.rpy	5407	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_7ca277b8	t	I'm not sorry, you hear me?	game/script.rpy	5408	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_c775d6c3	t	I struck out from the cruelty and bleakness and grey endless grinding of that machine, and I lived every day I was alive.	game/script.rpy	5409	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_8d28b4e5		Their laughter faded and they looked out at the moon with relief. They handed you the champagne.	game/script.rpy	5410	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_77d48502	t	I won.	game/script.rpy	5411	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_ab383527		The wind returned, howling like a monstrous beast.	game/script.rpy	5413	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_8ecee916		They looked at you with piercing clarity. You saw the moon reflected in their dark eyes.	game/script.rpy	5415	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_b7886ca2	t	Thank you, [povname]. For everything.	game/script.rpy	5416	t "[what]"

thiefSoloConvo2_5e6d7ef2	t	Tell those bastards I hated them all.	game/script.rpy	5419	t "[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_54a212f4		They gave you a sudden shove in the centre of your chest. You fell sprawling from the roof and slammed into the dirt, tumbling down the side of the hill and away from the train.	game/script.rpy	5420	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_50e1de58		The train hurtled past you in a blaze of smoke and fire, and then was gone.	game/script.rpy	5421	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_3cb34276		You lay in the underbrush, catching your breath, before staggering up.	game/script.rpy	5425	"[what]"

thiefSoloConvo2_84fe170d		You heard a soft grunting coming from the bush.	game/script.rpy	5432	"[what]"
thiefSoloConvo2_381ba792		The bushes rustled, and then your pig leapt out and into your arms, oinking joyfully. You cradled it softly.	game/script.rpy	5433	"[what]"

mushroomTales_fdcd2844	m	But I suppose a deal's a deal. I swear I will not curse you with a mushroom's curse.	game/script.rpy	5482	m "[what]"
mushroomTales_a9106423	m	This time.	game/script.rpy	5483	m "[what]"
mushroomTales_4bd0a45a	m	No need to worry about it, darling. I'm just glad you decided to come clean about your plan to steal our treasure.	game/script.rpy	5487	m "[what]"
mushroomTales_733cbce4	pov	No no... it's the Master Thief who's planning to steal the treasure.	game/script.rpy	5488	pov "[what]"
mushroomTales_7ac182c0	m	Right, the "Master Thief" you. But of course you can just stop yourself from doing it, right?	game/script.rpy	5489	m "[what]"
mushroomTales_b3180f96	pov	Uh - I - That's not...	game/script.rpy	5490	pov "[what]"
mushroomThiefBattle_d26f90c9		At just that moment, you noticed your cup had disappeared from your hand and been replaced with an old gumboot full of pond scum.	game/script.rpy	5493	"[what]"
mushroomThiefBattle_b69669f4		Your pig squealed a warning.	game/script.rpy	5495	"[what]"
mushroomThiefBattle_487b2cc7		You looked around and saw a shadow flit across the wall.	game/script.rpy	5497	"[what]"
mushroomThiefBattle_4ecce603		Grabbing a nearby jewelled scimitar, you leapt up from your seat and swung around to clash swords with the Master Thief!	game/script.rpy	5498	"[what]"
mushroomThiefBattle_61d488a0	t	Haha! You're learning.	game/script.rpy	5499	t "[what]"
mushroomThiefBattle_6ad908dc	t	There's still time, you know. Join me.	game/script.rpy	5500	t "[what]"
mushroomThiefBattle_3087acec	t	Together we'll spit in the face of the law and destroy the concept of private ownership once and for all.	game/script.rpy	5504	t "[what]" nointeract
mushroomThiefBattle_5a4e463d		You hesitated... and then you dropped your sword.	game/script.rpy	5507	"[what]"
mushroomThiefBattle_4194f500	t	Excellent. Now...	game/script.rpy	5508	t "[what]"
mushroomThiefBattle_d4b2f765	pov	Never!	game/script.rpy	5511	pov "[what]"
mushroomThiefBattle_e08adfb3		You pulled yourself up and fought fiercely across the glittering hills of treasure, gold pieces sliding away with every step.	game/script.rpy	5512	"[what]"
mushroomThiefBattle_90987862		The pig left bravely at the Master Thief, but they effortlessly dodged and it went rolling down the hill, squealing wildly.	game/script.rpy	5514	"[what]"
mushroomThiefBattle_a454b8e3		The Master Thief effortlessly riposted your blows with one hand, while the other hand darted around grabbing nearby gems and stuffing them into their cloak.	game/script.rpy	5515	"[what]"
mushroomSolo_644c2433		You walked through the woods.	game/script.rpy	5521	"[what]"
mushroomSolo_2c771d95		Soon you came upon an ancient strangler fig. You cut the vines and swamp flowers from it to reveal a small blue door, inlaid with precious moonstone and intricate engravings.	game/script.rpy	5524	"[what]"
mushroomSolo_9806f9db		The words already lurked in your mind.	game/script.rpy	5525	"[what]"
mushroomSolo_9c3cc80d	pov	Gorge, guzzle, gulp and grab; never shall this wound scab.	game/script.rpy	5526	pov "[what]"
mushroomSolo_f5785ab5		With this, the door opened before you, and you vanished inside immediately.	game/script.rpy	5527	"[what]"
mushroomSolo_b93f8c8d		Inside was a boundless cavern, cold as ice despite the heat outside.	game/script.rpy	5530	"[what]"
mushroomSolo_7cad57c0		The floor of the cavern was piled with rubies and pearls and glinting onyx and solid gold pieces, larger than your fist.	game/script.rpy	5531	"[what]"
mushroomSolo_85d6bd17		All across the room you saw lush silks and pillars of precious metals of every type and all manner of riches that would turn the King of Kings green with envy.	game/script.rpy	5532	"[what]"
mushroomSolo_cf83b469		The glimmering magenta incense smoke rolled across the room and coated it all in a dark haze, smelling of the most incredible spices and herbs and enchanting odours.	game/script.rpy	5533	"[what]"
mushroomSolo_67b7b86e	m	Come. It's time.	game/script.rpy	5534	m "[what]"
mushroomSolo_61268892		The mushroom startled you. She was holding a picnic basket. Her eyes were red.	game/script.rpy	5535	"[what]"
mushroomSolo_ad32521b	pov	Time for what?	game/script.rpy	5536	pov "[what]"
mushroomSolo_7f6a6732	m	I think you know, darling. I think you can see where this is going by now.	game/script.rpy	5537	m "[what]"
mushroomSolo_a490aca6	m	Carry those things for me please, will you?	game/script.rpy	5538	m "[what]"
mushroomSolo_67fb587f		You looked down and say bottles of red wine placed by the door. Two wineglasses were next to them. A small, neat pile of napkins.	game/script.rpy	5539	"[what]"
mushroomSolo_25daf377		Everything had been prepared long ago.	game/script.rpy	5540	"[what]"
mushroomSolo_766c9ac9		You picked up the supplies. The mushroom linked her arm with yours, and in a blink you were travelling down. Down through the rocks and the pillars of the earth. Down into the last kingdom.	game/script.rpy	5541	"[what]"
mushroomSolo_158b3fcb		Flickering silver light lit up the scene. All around you pressed a blooming mass of webcaps, milkcaps, scarlet elf caps, poisonpies, decievers, pinkgills, brittlegills, veiled ladies, lawyer's wigs, stinkhorns, earthstars, beefsteaks, chicken of the woods, earthballs, sculpted puffballs, yellowfoots, lungworts, brown-eyed wolves, golden-eyed umbrellas, Satan's boletes, false chanterelles, death caps and destroying angels, and all members of the mysterious Dark Taxa, the dark matter fungi that lie unknown to mankind.	game/script.rpy	5545	"[what]"
mushroomSolo_e7bbdda7		They all swept to and fro through a twisted city of endless tunnels. The shape of a giant, pale and broken mountain loomed over the city, barely visible through the thick fog of spores.	game/script.rpy	5546	"[what]"
mushroomSolo_ec7eee55	m	Don't worry dear, I've picked out a spot. I've had it picked out for a long time.	game/script.rpy	5547	m "[what]"
mushroomSolo_c56efae3		She took you through the throng of mushrooms and out onto a lonely hilltop overlooking the kingdom. A picnic rug was already laid on the moss. You could see the plants of the underworld rustling darkly in thick woods at the bottom of the hill, leading to the pale mountain beyond.	game/script.rpy	5550	"[what]"
mushroomSolo_fc1eaa63	m	Here we are.	game/script.rpy	5551	m "[what]"
mushroomSolo_fdae852d		She set tea-candles sparkling at each corner of the rug, and laid out a rich feast before you.	game/script.rpy	5552	"[what]"
mushroomSolo_7b56d60d		You took out the wineglasses, and she uncorked the wine and poured a toast.	game/script.rpy	5553	"[what]"
mushroomSolo_3ea8341e	m	To us.	game/script.rpy	5554	m "[what]"
mushroomSolo_9161085a		She looked away and discretely wiped her eyes.	game/script.rpy	5555	"[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_e529a808		The great pale mountain in the distance shifted in uneasy slumber.	game/script.rpy	5560	"[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_23bb6ac2		There was a distant sound from the darkness of the kingdom. Almost like howling.	game/script.rpy	5564	"[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_adbf0d4e		The plants down at the bottom of the hill shook, as if disturbed by the passage of a colossal beast.	game/script.rpy	5568	"[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_2a144bd9		Were there always this many stars in the sky? You found you couldn't recall.	game/script.rpy	5572	"[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_92707f21	m	I know you must be terribly worried. I'm sorry, dear.	game/script.rpy	5584	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_dfd398ce	m	I just wanted to sit, look out at the stars, and enjoy some nice wine and company.	game/script.rpy	5585	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_32e75684	m	I've thought about this moment so many times. This is how I wanted it to be at the end.	game/script.rpy	5586	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_332b5627		She cut off a small sliver of aged truffle cheese and spread it on a water cracker, then looked at it doubtfully.	game/script.rpy	5587	"[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_63d71012	m	Oh, to hell with it. No harm in it now.	game/script.rpy	5588	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_d47d6c10		She added an extra slice of cheese, a chilli and garlic olive, a piece of salami and a chunk of marinated artichoke heart onto the cracker, then gently eased the whole concoction into her mouth.	game/script.rpy	5589	"[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_ae77a96b	m	Do you think I did the right thing?	game/script.rpy	5594	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_761d1544	pov	Uh - 	game/script.rpy	5595	pov "[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_3dcd0f88	m	You don't know what I'm talking about. I'm sorry, I'm being quite self-indulgent, aren't I?	game/script.rpy	5596	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_4abdcc18	m	Well, you'll have to deal with it. This is my time and I'm going to be as self-indulgent as I damn well please.	game/script.rpy	5597	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_d4d964c4		She lathered some cream on a fresh-baked scone and took a delicate bite.	game/script.rpy	5598	"[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_c97c556e	m	It all seemed like the right choice at the time. But now it just feels like cowardice.	game/script.rpy	5599	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_320fe3f6	m	All those years I've spent in here. So many things I could have done in those years.	game/script.rpy	5600	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_24f40ddb	m	No use worrying about it now, of course. No point.	game/script.rpy	5601	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_9286cdf1	pov	Let's get out of here. We need to find somewhere safe.	game/script.rpy	5606	pov "[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_d9045485	m	No, no, no. Darling, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but there's no point.	game/script.rpy	5607	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_37ea91fa		She held the scones towards you with a stern glance until you took one.	game/script.rpy	5608	"[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_ba9c2c92	m	There never was an ending other than this. There never was a time other than this. No other place but this one.	game/script.rpy	5609	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_43a18cec	m	This is the True Ending. At least for me.	game/script.rpy	5611	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_9859d3a7	m	I made my decision a long time ago. And soon, I'm sure, you'll need to make yours.	game/script.rpy	5612	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_23e072c7	m	Do? Well, the next thing to do is the move on to this lovely lemon delicious I've packed us. And pour me another glass, please.	game/script.rpy	5617	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_6a186385	pov	I know something's wrong here, but I don't -	game/script.rpy	5618	pov "[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_b9bed351	m	Shh. Shh, dear.	game/script.rpy	5619	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_f67a8244	m	All we can do now is sit back and finish off the rest of this food. That's it.	game/script.rpy	5620	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_18887d99	m	What happens after that, you'll have to figure out for yourself. Just as we did.	game/script.rpy	5621	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_15b51930		The misty night air settled around the blanket. Flickering fireflies were visible in the distance. A haze of chirping from underground crickets washed over the scene.	game/script.rpy	5626	"[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_7d7b7bc5		A deep breath slowly came out of you. You let the weight in your shoulders slip away, piece by piece.	game/script.rpy	5627	"[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_b7486ea3		The mushroom's pale spores began to lift out of her cap and away down the hill in the breeze.	game/script.rpy	5628	"[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_28a214fa	m	Thank you for spending this time with me, darling.	game/script.rpy	5629	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_5d5098cb	m	You could have gone anywhere, couldn't you? Stayed with anyone.	game/script.rpy	5630	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloConvo_ccd772b4	m	I would ask you not to forget me. But I know that won't be possible. 	game/script.rpy	5631	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_89f9a846		The mushroom fell back onto the picnic rug and spread out her arms.	game/script.rpy	5637	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_a6477309		You lay down to join her and looked up at the sky above. A great, long sigh slowly eased out of her.	game/script.rpy	5641	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_ddb2e5d3	m	Have you ever looked back at your life and tried... tried to calculate the sheer volume of it that you've wasted? The just ungodly amount of time that you've let slip away?	game/script.rpy	5642	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_67d3f9f4	m	Of course I don't mean the time spent having picnics or afternoon naps, or watching the sky. That time isn't wasted.	game/script.rpy	5645	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_ac484070	m	I mean the time spent doing things you don't want to do, for people you don't care about.	game/script.rpy	5646	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_af3e4721	m	Those long decades spent paying rent, attending meetings, hunched over desks, travelling to work and back, doing all those petty grinding little tasks every day...	game/script.rpy	5649	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_0358d82d	m	It's horrifying. How incalculable a waste.	game/script.rpy	5652	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_9283d080		There was the sound of scratching. It seemed to come from somewhere inside you.	game/script.rpy	5653	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_e623580c	m	How many minutes and hours and days and years have vanished into that black yawning pit. It's impossible to even fit the number into my mind. It's nightmarish. The stars in the sky. The grains of sand on the beach... I can't even begin to take it in.	game/script.rpy	5656	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_4d8958bc	m	But every time you think about it, every time that number starts to creep into your mind, you think "There's still time," don't you?	game/script.rpy	5659	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_2e4babcb		The wine in your glasses rippled into complicated, twisting patterns. Like the entrails of beasts, from which omens might be read.	game/script.rpy	5660	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_4bd4047b	m	There's still time to chase that dream, there are still years left to me, I'll make it someday, I can turn this around, it'll all work out in the end! I'll start tomorrow.	game/script.rpy	5663	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_2dad1985	m	But there are no tomorrows left.	game/script.rpy	5666	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_eb720100		The earth shook beneath you. You almost thought you heard the impact of great footfalls. Almost upon you now.	game/script.rpy	5669	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_cde4d293	m	I can't say that anymore. It's done. The hours I spent are all the hours I'll ever have.	game/script.rpy	5670	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_0a4efd83	m	And... all throughout my life, the moments where I did something I really enjoyed were like small gasps of air between years of drowning.	game/script.rpy	5673	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_bb90b6fd		The night was getting darker and darker.	game/script.rpy	5674	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_66b6d466	m	I had to plan them and save up for them and spend every day just trying to hold out for the next one. Those tiny, tiny moments where I got to be alive.	game/script.rpy	5677	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_ceeeff89		Something was very close to you now. You didn't dare look. There was a smell like something rotting. A sound like something coiling in the grass.	game/script.rpy	5680	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_e7a1296b	m	All I have left now is that number. That percentage of waste.	game/script.rpy	5681	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_4d511081	m	It'll never get any smaller. It's done. It's all done.	game/script.rpy	5689	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_55a88b9d		Tears ran down her cheeks. She made no effort to hide them anymore. 	game/script.rpy	5690	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_c54d062e	m	Hold me, please.	game/script.rpy	5693	m "[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_3f2f5267		You tentatively put your arm around her, and she nestled into your shoulder and wept.	game/script.rpy	5694	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_956f51bf		You held her tight as you stared out into the night sky.	game/script.rpy	5695	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_5ef5253d		It was pitch black. No stars or moon brightened that abyss.	game/script.rpy	5702	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_a32a1cb0		You reached for the wine bottle, and realised there was none.	game/script.rpy	5703	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_1ee46c02		There were no wineglasses. There was no food.	game/script.rpy	5704	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_7fd6d38c		You felt the touch of moss underneath you. There was no blanket.	game/script.rpy	5705	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_bbbfd3cc		You looked down.	game/script.rpy	5706	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_929c0a1e		You were holding nothing at all. Your arms were embracing thin air.	game/script.rpy	5707	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_3797dba5		Why were you here?	game/script.rpy	5708	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_9d0ca283		You must have needed a rest. A night outdoors. 	game/script.rpy	5709	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_485e9302		All of us need some time to ourselves every now and then, don't we?	game/script.rpy	5710	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_4a4fd086		No harm in that.	game/script.rpy	5711	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_2f810dd3		You stood up. Brushed away the moss. Breathed in the cool night air.	game/script.rpy	5712	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_d10fbeb6		You felt warm, full, and sad, for no reason you could name.	game/script.rpy	5713	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_463c28e9		Finally you began the long walk home in silence, with the dark night sky looming above you.	game/script.rpy	5714	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_cd5d5a8a		There's nothing else left to tell.	game/script.rpy	5715	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_bd257120		That's the end.	game/script.rpy	5716	"[what]"
mushroomSoloFinale_9256611c		Run away with it now, as fast as you can.	game/script.rpy	5718	"[what]"
mushroomFinale_d1dcc18f	m	Oh dear.	game/script.rpy	5749	m "[what]"
mushroomFinale_d841f04a		Another mushroom, identical to the lady, emerged from a side door.	game/script.rpy	5750	"[what]"
mushroomFinale_a9f99b92	m2	I know, it's awful.	game/script.rpy	5751	m2 "[what]"
mushroomFinale_8ea28495	m2	I mean, what are [he] trying to say, here? I think we can find a vague stab towards meaning in this performance, but who's the audience?	game/script.rpy	5753	m2 "[what]"
mushroomFinale_b2a79bb7	m2	I mean, what is [he] trying to say, here? I think we can find a vague stab towards meaning in this performance, but who's the audience?	game/script.rpy	5755	m2 "[what]"
mushroomFinale_cf29e45a		You stumbled and teetered at the edge of a cliff as the thief's stabs pushed you backwards. Another identical mushroom popped up.	game/script.rpy	5756	"[what]"
mushroomFinale_5ece31e9	m4	Perhaps it's meant to be ironic.	game/script.rpy	5757	m4 "[what]"
mushroomFinale_3f211b44	m2	Perhaps it's satirical.	game/script.rpy	5758	m2 "[what]"
mushroomFinale_302b9ed0	m3	Yes, but what is it satirising?	game/script.rpy	5759	m3 "[what]"
mushroomFinale_5816ce92		You regained your footing and slashed the thief's sword out of their hands. Just as you were on the brink of victory, mushrooms swarmed up and surrounded you.	game/script.rpy	5760	"[what]"
mushroomFinale_f4a597d4		Your pig leapt into your arms in fear.	game/script.rpy	5762	"[what]"
mushroomFinale_6058f994	m	I think we've seen enough. It's time to get off the stage.	game/script.rpy	5763	m "[what]"
mushroomFinale_581867d3		Before you could blink, they took hold of your ankles and dragged you down into the earth.	game/script.rpy	5764	"[what]"
mushroomFinale_b02f1ffb	m3	Shh. Shhh.	game/script.rpy	5765	m3 "[what]"
mushroomFinale_38c947e5		The Master Thief managed to wriggle out of their grasp.	game/script.rpy	5766	"[what]"
mushroomFinale_b3c20662	t	Au revoir, my friend!	game/script.rpy	5767	t "[what]"
mushroomFinale_61ff9c22		You heard the thunder of a rattling train carriage outside. In a smooth motion, they leapt out of the window, onto the train and out of sight.	game/script.rpy	5768	"[what]"
mushroomFinale_bade8a30		That was the last thing you saw before you were dragged underneath the earth.	game/script.rpy	5771	"[what]"
mushroomFinale_63b6439a		You and the pig were pulled down through untold layers of dirt by your ankles. You heard the mushrooms whisper around you.	game/script.rpy	5773	"[what]"
mushroomFinale_70e19487		You were pulled down through untold layers of dirt by your ankles. You heard the mushrooms whisper around you.	game/script.rpy	5775	"[what]"
mushroomFinale_eff21193	m3	Everything's going to be ok. You're safe here. Shhhh.	game/script.rpy	5776	m3 "[what]"
mushroomFinale_793ec059		Soon, you emerged into a colossal underground kingdom lit with flickering silver light.	game/script.rpy	5779	"[what]"
mushroomFinale_6dfa11a5		All around you pressed a blooming mass of webcaps, milkcaps, scarlet elf caps, poisonpies, decievers, pinkgills, brittlegills, veiled ladies, lawyer's wigs, stinkhorns, earthstars, beefsteaks, chicken of the woods, earthballs, sculpted puffballs, yellowfoots, lungworts, brown-eyed wolves, golden-eyed umbrellas, Satan's boletes, false chanterelles, death caps and destroying angels, and all members of the mysterious Dark Taxa, the dark matter fungi that lie unknown to mankind.	game/script.rpy	5781	"[what]"
mushroomFinale_e7bbdda7		They all swept to and fro through a twisted city of endless tunnels. The shape of a giant, pale and broken mountain loomed over the city, barely visible through the thick fog of spores.	game/script.rpy	5783	"[what]"
mushroomFinale_f48039eb	pov	I was about to win! Why have you kidnapped me?	game/script.rpy	5784	pov "[what]"
mushroomFinale_d17af1f9	m	Darling, trust us, that sad production wasn't going to win anything. You were hurting yourself.	game/script.rpy	5785	m "[what]"
mushroomFinale_4114e8e9	m2	Hurting yourself.	game/script.rpy	5786	m2 "[what]"
mushroomFinale_8d0c34da	m	Please don't take the criticism too personally. It was an intriguing bit of invisible theatre. We do respect the way you put everything into the role.	game/script.rpy	5787	m "[what]"
mushroomFinale_326f13e8		Dozens of identical mushrooms pressed around you, speaking in soft, overlapping voices.	game/script.rpy	5788	"[what]"
mushroomFinale_6c9ee871	m3	I think it might be best if you stay here until I know that you're safe. Until I know you're safe. It's for the best, if you stay here.	game/script.rpy	5789	m3 "[what]"
mushroomFinale_087062c6	m4	I'll watch over you. Over you. Watch over.	game/script.rpy	5790	m4 "[what]"
mushroomFinale_f718c8f1		You were taken through a decadant palace of yellow chanterelles and given robes of fine moss. Your room was lushly furnished with soft covers woven from black mushroom silk. Your pig had his own quarters and a bevy of servants to attend to his every whim. All the gems and gold and treasures of the earth were available to you both.	game/script.rpy	5794	"[what]"

mushroomExplore_fa5066e1		You saw the four seasons all flowering at once. To the north, the cicadas and crickets chirped loudly in a summer haze. To the south, the ground was silver white with snow.

mushroomExplore_0e55e7fd		You spent days among them, learning their intricate customs. You realised that the forest you knew was an intricate web of delicate alliances between opposing factions that hated each other with bitter envy.	game/script.rpy	5909	"[what]"
mushroomExplore_f6a66f77	m3	Exhausting, isn't it? But it must be done.	game/script.rpy	5910	m3 "[what]"

mushroomExplore_31d11569		When you heard those odd words, a terrible fear gripped you, and you ran out onto the street and through the twisting alleyways. The forest you knew was gone.

thiefDisappears_472d5772		It was never seen again.	game/script.rpy	6203	"[what]"
toad1_7d198a09		He gulped down the rest of his plate and stumbled unsteadily away from the table.	game/script.rpy	6210	"[what]"

toad1_988773b2		You both stepped into the squash carriage, and it went rattling away down the path into the rainforest.	game/script.rpy	6214	"[what]"
toad1_f58fdaeb		As you went down the road, the forest began to get darker and darker.	game/script.rpy	6217	"[what]"

toad1_1e4ec77d	cockatoo	Not good enough. Get him, boys!	game/script.rpy	6231	cockatoo "[what]"

toad1_2b015e8a		Then they turned to you and respectfully escorted you from the carriage.	game/script.rpy	6233	"[what]"

toad1_8b8afecd	f	A-another successful adventure! Good thing I was able to fight off those ruffians!	game/script.rpy	6252	f "[what]"
toad1_072c6977		He coughed up some mud from the ditch, shuddering weakly.	game/script.rpy	6253	"[what]"
toad1_65dd26db		Then he stood up and said to himself sternly:	game/script.rpy	6254	"[what]"
toad1_47a5c784	f	I am Bridlebrogue Chippingham, and I've never failed at anything in my life.	game/script.rpy	6255	f "[what]"
toad1_01cb5bff		With this, he regained his former swagger and strode forward.	game/script.rpy	6256	"[what]"
toad1_76078d80		The night grew dark.	game/script.rpy	6257	"[what]"
toad1_20a97d78		You walked through the trees together.	game/script.rpy	6258	"[what]"

toad1_5313148f	pov	Have you been through this part of the forest before?	game/script.rpy	6274	pov "[what]"
toad1_dacfc0e3	f	Oh... no, of course not. No, I'm far too busy being off at more important places, with more important people. All across the world. Barely have a moment to myself, you know.	game/script.rpy	6275	f "[what]"
toad1_2fefba53	f	I wouldn't have the slightest idea what it's like to live in a swamp like this. Ha. Ha.	game/script.rpy	6276	f "[what]"
toad1_724422ec	f	Come on, we can't let ourselves be cowed by a little darkness! Why, I remember when I was journeying through the pits of Arborkios, where darkness is forged on a black anvil of star-stuff, and the blackest night shelters for rest each night after being torn apart by the light of day each morning! Well, I marched right on through that black pit, and I said -	game/script.rpy	6277	f "[what]"
toad1_fbf3e6bc	f	Ack!	game/script.rpy	6278	f "[what]"
toad1_6a39c858		You heard him trip over in front of you and go tumbling down and down through the muck of the rainforest until he fell into a deep pit and landed at the bottom with a crash.	game/script.rpy	6279	"[what]"
toad1_0f1f9765		You picked your way carefully down to him.	game/script.rpy	6280	"[what]"
toad1_01df78fb	f	Never fear! I have found... a shortcut!	game/script.rpy	6281	f "[what]"
toad1_86f1e3dd		The pig pushed the toad with its snout.	game/script.rpy	6283	"[what]"
toad1_dcddb205	f	I just... need a moment. M-might have... sprained my ankle there, I think. And maybe my arm.	game/script.rpy	6284	f "[what]"
toad1_9d860f48		He wheezed and lay there in the mud for a long time, breathing heavily and trying not to cry.	game/script.rpy	6285	"[what]"
toad1_70d36b2f		You heard him whisper to himself weakly.	game/script.rpy	6286	"[what]"

toad1_d9f31646	f	W-what are you doing? Wait!	game/script.rpy	6302	f "[what]"
toad1_f033040b		His voice faded behind you as you walked away into the darkness.	game/script.rpy	6303	"[what]"
toad1_faef132d		You walked on. Soon, you began to see a glimmer of silver light in the darkness.	game/script.rpy	6307	"[what]"
toad1_0780a027		The forest was covered in puddles of water from the rains. Each one shone with light.	game/script.rpy	6310	"[what]"
toad1_0a2eced7		All around you, the woods were dark and empty. But when you looked into the water, you saw the reflection of a shining cottage below.	game/script.rpy	6311	"[what]"
toad1_0ae9bcd0			game/script.rpy	6315	"[what]"
toad1_1668d521		For a brief moment, you thought you saw a figure reflected in the water. But as soon as you blinked, it was gone.	game/script.rpy	6320	"[what]"
puddle_e7f50077		You crawled to the edge and looked down into the puddle.	game/script.rpy	6332	"[what]"
puddle_7cd147f0		The surface of the water was flat and still.	game/script.rpy	6333	"[what]"

puddle_61023088		There was no trace of a cottage in the world above the water.	game/script.rpy	6339	"[what]"
puddle_26014a45		You picked up a stick from the ground, and tossed it into the puddle.	game/script.rpy	6343	"[what]"
puddle_ff499cad		It fell in without a single ripple in the water.	game/script.rpy	6344	"[what]"
puddle_ac59d260		You saw it drop through into the reflection, and land close to the cottage.	game/script.rpy	6345	"[what]"
puddle_37e73c24		You looked up. There was no trace of it in the world outside the reflection.	game/script.rpy	6346	"[what]"
puddle_7be3ad39		You grabbed the pig and the toad to you, then leapt into the puddle.	game/script.rpy	6351	"[what]"
puddle_7b024584		You held the toad tight, then leapt into the puddle.	game/script.rpy	6353	"[what]"
puddle_34bd7779		The world flipped over.	game/script.rpy	6356	"[what]"
puddle_17e60d48		You felt the water pass over you, and a cool chill tingled all through your body.	game/script.rpy	6357	"[what]"
puddle_f108985a		When you opened your eyes, you were standing right way up again.	game/script.rpy	6360	"[what]"
puddle_0fec5802		The puddle you had jumped into was now a floor, like a silver mirror.	game/script.rpy	6361	"[what]"
puddle_f590bf40		The world all around you shone white.	game/script.rpy	6362	"[what]"
puddle_fb1d5a14		At the centre of the puddle was the cottage, shining with light.	game/script.rpy	6363	"[what]"
puddle_d9f83a34		The toad was very quiet now. His fine suit was ruined with mud. He jumped out of your hand and sat down.	game/script.rpy	6364	"[what]"
puddle_43df4ffe	f	You'd... better go on. I'd just slow you down.	game/script.rpy	6366	f "[what]"
puddle_952da51c	pov	Thanks for pretending to fall down back there.	game/script.rpy	6373	pov "[what]"
puddle_e956e03d	f	What?	game/script.rpy	6374	f "[what]"
puddle_71665a20	pov	Well, I know you must have done it deliberately. Just so I would have something to do.	game/script.rpy	6375	pov "[what]"

witchDisappears_3c76304b		How did locks work? How did one interact with a door? The latch, the key, the handle - what were these things, and how did they fit together?	game/script.rpy	6977	"[what]"
witchDisappears_32e8487c		The knowledge was gone.	game/script.rpy	6978	"[what]"
witchDisappears_740fab77		She clawed at it, but it was just a wooden rectangle now, an abstract shape with no meaning. Another gaping wound in her mind, still fresh and dripping.	game/script.rpy	6979	"[what]"

toadSolo_7981517c		The squash rattled and bumped down the road with haste. The toad attempted some witty anecdotes while you pretended to listen.	game/script.rpy	7030	"[what]"
toadSolo_d5139881		Finally you arrived at a stately riverside manor.	game/script.rpy	7037	"[what]"
toadSolo_c18786cb		With a clap of his hands, the toad summoned a cavalcade of richly dressed frog manservants, who poured flutes of champagne while offering spontaneous and completely unplanned anecdotes about the incredible things Brildebrogue Chippingham had said or done lately.	game/script.rpy	7038	"[what]"
toadSolo_c78d97b4		With another click, a dozen beautiful frog maids escorted you to golden baths where all the dirt of the journey was washed away. The finest frog soprano choir in all the land serenaded you with tales of Brildebrogue Chippingham's latest exploits.	game/script.rpy	7039	"[what]"
toadSolo_6c20166b		All the while, the toad's servants pretended to laugh at his jokes as he tipped them generously.	game/script.rpy	7040	"[what]"
toadSolo_2f39eeaa	f	Yes, please make yourself at home, my dear friend! We are friends now, right?	game/script.rpy	7041	f "[what]"
toadSolo_c6bb71fb	f	That is to say, of course we are! I have so many friends these days, you know. In fact I may be completely tied up with them and all the time we spend together constantly, doing all the things friends do, you know, but never fear, I won't forget the little people such as yourself, my dear friend, we shall certainly have some time to spend together.	game/script.rpy	7042	f "[what]"
toadSolo_0fd11825	pov	Have you... always owned this manor?	game/script.rpy	7043	pov "[what]"
toadSolo_aa14438d	f	Of course! The manor is owned by me, Brildebrogue Chippingham! That's my name! Why would you think otherwise?	game/script.rpy	7045	f "[what]"
toadSolo_70222283	f	Anyway, no time to talk about trivialities such as property ownership, I have a party to plan! It will begin soon, you'd better make ready!	game/script.rpy	7046	f "[what]"

chippinghamManorSolo_f10177ca		Inside the third tower, you discovered a collection of fine frog bards, composing poems and arias in Brildebrogue's name that moved you to tears just to hear them.	game/script.rpy	7086	"[what]"
chippinghamManorSolo_b8329627		The whole fourth tower was taken up by a looming pyramid. Atop it stood a gigantic sculpture of Brildebrogue, vomiting forth emeralds and sapphires and precious gems.	game/script.rpy	7092	"[what]"
chippinghamManorSolo_f92503a8		Inside the fifth tower were the greatest frog artists of their age, furiously painting a series of refined portraits of Brildebrogue at rest.	game/script.rpy	7097	"[what]"

chippinghamManorSolo_29315f0d		Inside the seventh and tallest tower you found only a tiny wooden closet.	game/script.rpy	7106	"[what]"

chippinghamManorSolo_046eae35		The eyes were gone. The mouth had rotted away. It was all that remained of Brildebrogue Chippingham.	game/script.rpy	7121	"[what]"
toadConstruct_45d75de8		The toad was busy reinforcing the manor's defences.	game/script.rpy	7144	"[what]"
toadConstruct_414bdd6d		Golden locks were placed on every door, and silver bars at every window.	game/script.rpy	7145	"[what]"
toadConstruct_aeae3667		Hordes of guests began arriving for the gala. Notable political figures, great artists or famed adventurers from the swamplands.	game/script.rpy	7148	"[what]"

toadConstruct_6969853d	f	Build faster.	game/script.rpy	7159	f "[what]"
toadConstruct_14d83559		The labourers increased their speed. A layer of mercury was bound into the walls of the manor.	game/script.rpy	7160	"[what]"
toadConstruct_ad89a823		The party intensified. Scenes of froggish debauchery played out all around you.	game/script.rpy	7161	"[what]"
toadConstruct_08e5fb7b		Layers of ash and salt were drawn around the mansion.	game/script.rpy	7164	"[what]"
toadConstruct_65de4e76		The doors were barred. Guests weren't allowed to enter or leave.	game/script.rpy	7165	"[what]"
toadConstruct_74ec3432		They didn't seem to care. Fine swamp cocktails were handed out and a big band played on into the night.	game/script.rpy	7166	"[what]"

toadConstruct_e2eae5c7		It yawned underneath the manor like an open mouth.	game/script.rpy	7179	"[what]"
toadConstruct_7e4b2b61		The walls were thick. Impenetrable in every way. Every possible ward had been laid upon them.	game/script.rpy	7180	"[what]"

toadSoloFinale_34156d80	f	I see you've found it.	game/script.rpy	7199	f "[what]"

toadSoloFinale_ad7a75e7	f	In a time already long past, I came to this mansion as a lowly servant. My name in those days was Blort.	game/script.rpy	7202	f "[what]"
toadSoloFinale_47f91eb7	f	The manor was owned by a frog named Brildebrogue Chippingham, who was so handsome that light shone from his face as if from the sun.

toadSoloFinale_9e909742	f	Sweeping his floors, and dusting his closets, I searched through the manor each night.	game/script.rpy	7204	f "[what]"
toadSoloFinale_132e0393	f	Finally, I found his secret.	game/script.rpy	7205	f "[what]"
toadSoloFinale_b0a8bc47	f	I stole his key, and left it in the hall, so that he would find it and think something was wrong.	game/script.rpy	7206	f "[what]"

toadSoloFinale_f12238dd	f	In a panic, he ran to the cupboard on the seventh floor of the seventh tower.	game/script.rpy	7209	f "[what]"
toadSoloFinale_3674a98d	f	He wrested open the door in a feverish state.	game/script.rpy	7210	f "[what]"

toadSoloFinale_feb1ebc2	f	I slammed the door. I took up his clothes and his mantle.	game/script.rpy	7222	f "[what]"
toadSoloFinale_6fd9dd8e	f	None can tell the difference. Or perhaps they don't care to, as long as I keep the money flowing.	game/script.rpy	7223	f "[what]"
toadSoloFinale_67f2ef85		The sounds of laughter and music echoed from behind the door.	game/script.rpy	7224	"[what]"

toadSoloFinale_5858372c		The toad walked over and swung the closet door shut.	game/script.rpy	7228	"[what]"
toadSoloFinale_e510ec64		A frog sage appeared to inform you both that the vault was ready.	game/script.rpy	7229	"[what]"
toadSoloFinale_dccde09a	f	Good. Come with me.	game/script.rpy	7230	f "[what]"
toadSoloFinale_4e42958b		You both walked down through the manor, past the riotous party, down to the vault in the basement.	game/script.rpy	7233	"[what]"
toadSoloFinale_8999b090	pov	Is this really what you want?	game/script.rpy	7234	pov "[what]"
toadSoloFinale_6d443ff9	f	Of course. This is the life I always desired. This is why I took the deal, all those years ago.	game/script.rpy	7235	f "[what]"
toadSoloFinale_c04da5ca		The toad walked into the cyclopean, hungry mouth of the vault.	game/script.rpy	7236	"[what]"
toadSoloFinale_c8cd2935	pov	Why don't you give up the charade? Come with me. You can live in the village. As your true self.	game/script.rpy	7237	pov "[what]"
toadSoloFinale_1482811d	f	No. I've come too far now.	game/script.rpy	7239	f "[what]"

toadSoloFinale_93397a63	f	There is nothing to fear. I am already immortal.	game/script.rpy	7244	f "[what]"
toadSoloFinale_43fbb874		You embraced. The cavernous emptiness of his vault loomed before him.	game/script.rpy	7245	"[what]"
toadSoloFinale_7e1eb1b3		He gave you a final wave. Then, he was swallowed up into the darkness.	game/script.rpy	7246	"[what]"
toadSoloFinale_d53371bd		The lock sealed. The magic shook the earth, and a golden sigil appeared upon it.	game/script.rpy	7247	"[what]"
toadSoloFinale_cb4d82c5		The barriers were set. The guards of silver, gold, lead, rowan, ash, oak, and the final layer of bone. Seven auras, which lay upon the manor like seven cloaks.	game/script.rpy	7248	"[what]"
toadSoloFinale_48c9bdff		A slow silence seeped up into the house.	game/script.rpy	7253	"[what]"
toadSoloFinale_6807b8a4		As you wiped the tears away, you wondered what you were crying about.	game/script.rpy	7254	"[what]"
toadSoloFinale_4b8b9f3c		Where did these tears come from? You strained your memory, but you could not recall.	game/script.rpy	7255	"[what]"
toadSoloFinale_6a3a0630		You found yourself in a large, empty manor, for no reason you could remember.	game/script.rpy	7256	"[what]"

toadSoloFinale_06ad904b		Ah, well. No need to worry.	game/script.rpy	7258	"[what]"
toadSoloFinale_ca82d50b		You dried your eyes, and began the walk back to the village.	game/script.rpy	7259	"[what]"
toadSoloFinale_956c1e90		There is nothing else to tell.	game/script.rpy	7260	"[what]"

toadSoloFinale_f911c8f8		The rat’s tail is off. That’s the end.	game/script.rpy	7265	"[what]"
witch2_291b83d9		You walked up the front steps, and put your hand on the doorknob.	game/script.rpy	7276	"[what]"
witch2_2023ba25		The door opened up with a shuddering creak.	game/script.rpy	7277	"[what]"
witch2_bbf6278c		You and the pig slowly crept forward.	game/script.rpy	7279	"[what]"
witch2_e88f7e75		Inside the cottage was a wild clutter of books and herbs and plants of all description, growing up the walls and roof.	game/script.rpy	7282	"[what]"
witch2_d4f41332		The cottage was tiny, but the walls were covered with bookshelves stuffed with old manuscripts and notebooks and thick textbooks on all kinds of plants and animals.	game/script.rpy	7283	"[what]"
witch2_b8ea80a2		The wooden bookshelves were sprouting with herbs and plants of every type.	game/script.rpy	7285	"[what]"
witch2_7244cb3c		In the corner was a small kitchen with a cauldron, and up above was a small attic crawl-space.	game/script.rpy	7286	"[what]"
witch2_5d203b06		Out of the attic poked a small head with a giant black hat. It looked at you with shock.	game/script.rpy	7287	"[what]"
witch2_5b299973	w	Oh!	game/script.rpy	7288	w "[what]"
witch2_16573296		It quickly withdrew into the rafters and you heard a crash.	game/script.rpy	7289	"[what]"
witch2_ba70565b		After a moment, out popped the witch, carrying a thick binder of notes and the remains of a broken pot plant.	game/script.rpy	7290	"[what]"
witch2_42946bbc	w	Um... hello!	game/script.rpy	7291	w "[what]"
witch2_e0488cab		She set about trying to fix the pot plant back together with tape from her belt.	game/script.rpy	7292	"[what]"
witch2_ef257fbe		Coiling, midnight blue smoke slowly rose out from under her hat, fogging up the whole upper half of the cottage.	game/script.rpy	7293	"[what]"

witch2_3b0b3dfa	w	I have so much tea and I never get a chance to drink most of it because...	game/script.rpy	7298	w "[what]"
witch2_36b3c726		Her expression became vague and confused.	game/script.rpy	7299	"[what]"
witch2_2877d726	w	Because, uh... why do I...	game/script.rpy	7301	w "[what]"
witch2_d0143bf0	w	Oh, the caffeine, that's right. The caffeine makes me too wired and I can't get to sleep at night, so I have to stick to all the herbal stuff.	game/script.rpy	7302	w "[what]"
witch2_a0741568	w	But you don't have to take the black tea if you don't want to, I have all kinds, it's fine. Or you don't have to have any kind of tea at all, that's totally fine too, I don't want to be out here stuffing tea down your mouth.	game/script.rpy	7303	w "[what]"

puddleSolo_17e60d48		You felt the water pass over you, and a cool chill tingled all through your body.	game/script.rpy	8179	"[what]"
puddleSolo_f108985a		When you opened your eyes, you were standing right way up again.	game/script.rpy	8182	"[what]"
puddleSolo_0fec5802		The puddle you had jumped into was now a floor, like a silver mirror.	game/script.rpy	8183	"[what]"
puddleSolo_f590bf40		The world all around you shone white.	game/script.rpy	8184	"[what]"
puddleSolo_fb1d5a14		At the centre of the puddle was the cottage, shining with light.	game/script.rpy	8185	"[what]"
puddleSolo_6c41c5cb		Up over the walls grew a riot of herbs and flowers of every type, planted directly in the soil, rambling over everything and growing in a lush green-grass garden on the roof. 	game/script.rpy	8188	"[what]"
puddleSolo_694585b8		The pig munched on some violets blooming from the windowsill.	game/script.rpy	8190	"[what]"
puddleSolo_f890bbcc	w	Oh good!	game/script.rpy	8191	w "[what]"
puddleSolo_14ec4b4f		You stumbled back in surprise as a small, witchy figure popped out from behind the herbs.	game/script.rpy	8192	"[what]"
puddleSolo_7ed41cad		Her hands were covered in ink. She had a fountain pen tucked behind her ear, a chaotic scramble of notepaper tucked under her arm and a thick bundle of string wrapped around her hand.	game/script.rpy	8193	"[what]"
puddleSolo_82028319	w	You're just in time. [povname], right?	game/script.rpy	8194	w "[what]"
puddleSolo_0f7d6c66		She took out a fork wrapped in string and planted it firmly by her doorstep. It was labelled "A1".	game/script.rpy	8195	"[what]"
puddleSolo_27ab82eb		You looked around and noticed that her whole backyard was littered with forks stabbed into the ground. Each fork was tied with a knot of string and labelled with a letter of the alphabet. The lines of string led to a massive tangle of twine in her front window.	game/script.rpy	8196	"[what]"
puddleSolo_007fab50	w	Come on. You're just in time for the next round of experiments.	game/script.rpy	8197	w "[what]"
puddleSolo_f22b4ceb		She grabbed your hand and pulled you inside.	game/script.rpy	8198	"[what]"
puddleSolo_e88f7e75		Inside the cottage was a wild clutter of books and herbs and plants of all description, growing up the walls and roof.	game/script.rpy	8201	"[what]"
puddleSolo_4477c5b1		The cottage was cramped, but the walls were covered with lines of string and notes and paper scrawled with indecipherable writing.	game/script.rpy	8202	"[what]"
puddleSolo_62818470		The floor was covered in a network of flags and string in a grid pattern, each flag marked with a letter and number. You stepped over them gingerly to enter the room.	game/script.rpy	8204	"[what]"
puddleSolo_8f83047e		A message was painted across the wall in giant red letters: "I OWN THIRTY TWO FORKS."	game/script.rpy	8205	"[what]"
puddleSolo_adc3c8b7	w	We have two experiments running at the moment.	game/script.rpy	8206	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_281fdc01		You heard something in the walls. Like clawing.	game/script.rpy	8227	"[what]"
witchExperiments_fb16a057		You looked at the walls of the cottage and noticed something odd about them. It was like a picture that had been folded in on itself and reflected.	game/script.rpy	8228	"[what]"
witchExperiments_4854b131		The witch didn't seem to notice.	game/script.rpy	8229	"[what]"
witchExperiments_a1716ce3		You blinked and rubbed your eyes furiously. There was a queer distortion in the air.	game/script.rpy	8231	"[what]"
witchExperiments_acf00d0b		The air was completely clear, and the cottage was well-lit.	game/script.rpy	8232	"[what]"
witchExperiments_acdcbd81		But still, for some reason you couldn't see more than five feet ahead of you.	game/script.rpy	8233	"[what]"
witchExperiments_1f05e6f0		You heard a scrabbling sound.	game/script.rpy	8235	"[what]"
witchExperiments_3fcdfd33		It was coming from inside you. Like claws scratching in the creases of your brain.	game/script.rpy	8236	"[what]"
witchExperiments_5fd8e849		Trying to get in.	game/script.rpy	8237	"[what]"
witchExperiments_e31b0316		You were having difficulty speaking. But you slowly walked forward and kept asking questions.	game/script.rpy	8238	"[what]"
witchExperiments_433fc246		You felt a deep pressure settle on you. Like being at the bottom of the ocean. Compressing your body from all angles. Your intestines knotted and twisted in coiled spirals.	game/script.rpy	8240	"[what]"
witchExperiments_74fe3587		It was done.	game/script.rpy	8241	"[what]"
witchExperiments_5d329421		The witch noticed nothing.	game/script.rpy	8242	"[what]"
witchExperiments_3cd40010	w	We need to warn people. Your family, especially.	game/script.rpy	8243	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_661baa8e	w	What do you want to see?	game/script.rpy	8248	w "[what]" nointeract
witchExperiments_c84b8e99	w	Crystal ball. Perks of being a witch.	game/script.rpy	8251	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_a00f2320	w	I was watching your house.	game/script.rpy	8252	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_f5b37c87		She laid her pile of notes down on the kitchen bench and scribbled in them as she talked.	game/script.rpy	8253	"[what]"
witchExperiments_fcf8d56b		There were dark bags under her eyes. It was clear she hadn't slept in days.	game/script.rpy	8254	"[what]"
witchExperiments_c0416782	w	I was so happy when I saw you were coming. There's something here you need to see.	game/script.rpy	8255	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_4ee95f3b	pov	So what's experiment 1?	game/script.rpy	8262	pov "[what]"
witchExperiments_322c9104		The witch gestured to the network of flags at her feet.	game/script.rpy	8263	"[what]"
witchExperiments_ca0e9b8d	w	This is what started everything.	game/script.rpy	8264	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_b6bfc703	w	When I woke up a few days ago, I noticed something.	game/script.rpy	8265	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_a35c9984	w	Usually when I make my morning tea, it takes me 4 steps to get from the kettle to my front door.	game/script.rpy	8266	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_5f488e92	w	But when I made it that morning... it took me 3 steps.	game/script.rpy	8267	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_5535b95b	pov	What?	game/script.rpy	8268	pov "[what]"
witchExperiments_66976c91	w	It's shrinking. You see?	game/script.rpy	8269	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_d05ff6c7		She points at the grid of flags laid all across the cottage floor.	game/script.rpy	8270	"[what]"
witchExperiments_dcf49389	w	The flags start here.	game/script.rpy	8271	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_229c5bae		She pointed to the front left corner of the cottage, at a flag labelled "G-02".	game/script.rpy	8272	"[what]"
witchExperiments_df0be604	w	And they end here.	game/script.rpy	8273	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_95265691		She points to the lower right corner of the house, at a flag labelled "Z-10".	game/script.rpy	8274	"[what]"
witchExperiments_fd2bd86e	w	But why would I do that? Why would I start the naming system at G-02, instead of A-01? How does that make sense as a numbering system?	game/script.rpy	8275	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_d64e2560	pov	It... doesn't.	game/script.rpy	8277	pov "[what]"
witchExperiments_e63fdc3b	w	Exactly.	game/script.rpy	8278	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_ac2ca41e	w	Here's my hypothesis. The initial numbering system began at A-01. Since then, the space has shrunk.	game/script.rpy	8279	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_76615cc5	w	That's why the system now begins at this flag here, "H-03."	game/script.rpy	8280	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_671aac6a		She pointed at the starting flag.	game/script.rpy	8281	"[what]"
witchExperiments_2e091adf	pov	But if the cottage was shrinking, we'd notice it.	game/script.rpy	8282	pov "[what]"
witchExperiments_b1e3ae77	w	Not necessarily. My theory is that there is some kind of pressure, or force, that is stopping us from noticing or remembering. I just couldn't prove it - until I hit on the fork hypothesis.	game/script.rpy	8283	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_b06f6851		She looked at you with a cold certainty.	game/script.rpy	8284	"[what]"
witchExperiments_32f9159f	w	Things are being devoured. Not just from physical reality. From our minds.	game/script.rpy	8285	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_875ce893		You stared down at the starting flag, in the front left corner of the cottage.	game/script.rpy	8286	"[what]"
witchExperiments_8404e708		It read "I-03". Just like it always did.	game/script.rpy	8287	"[what]"
witchExperiments_902ec136		The witch took you over to her front window, which you could see was stuffed with a giant, knotted network of string.	game/script.rpy	8292	"[what]"
witchExperiments_7dbe6338		The string was labelled with all the letters of the alphabet. It stretched out through the window.	game/script.rpy	8293	"[what]"
witchExperiments_9f3e1c54		You looked outside and saw that it was tied onto dozens of forks stuck into the soil, all over her property.	game/script.rpy	8294	"[what]"
witchExperiments_58c9b996	w	Once I encountered the Lacuna phenomenon, I tried to think of a way to measure it.	game/script.rpy	8295	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_a601e67a	pov	Lacuna?	game/script.rpy	8296	pov "[what]"
witchExperiments_708bcce4	w	A gap, a blind spot. A space that shouldn't be there.	game/script.rpy	8297	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_f0aa4a54	w	I tried to figure out where it's coming from - what's causing it. I tested out time of day - no results there. Are some objects more likely to disappear than others? Again, no visible pattern there. 	game/script.rpy	8298	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_e864c83b	w	I had a breakthrough when I considered that it might be location based. Emanating from a particular point. The closer an object is to that point, the more likely it is to disappear. But I couldn't make any meaningful progress because I couldn't prove whether or not something had disappeared.	game/script.rpy	8299	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_636fb602		She held up a fork.	game/script.rpy	8302	"[what]"
witchExperiments_56d7d2fa	w	Say this fork vanished. And not only that, but it vanished so completely that you never remembered it existing at all. How could you prove that it ever existed?	game/script.rpy	8303	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_2f0b5bfe	w	How do you prove something used to exist, if that thing now does not exist, and never did?	game/script.rpy	8309	w "[what]" nointeract
witchExperiments_cf966a07	w	That's the scary part. Even my notes no longer mention the fork ever existing.	game/script.rpy	8312	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_32fefa38	w	Somehow even they have been re-written by the new, forkless reality.	game/script.rpy	8313	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_c516578a	w	No, I've only found one way to detect the change.	game/script.rpy	8314	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_cc95a1ba	w	Fantastic idea, but sadly impractical. I have consulted the Devil on this, of course.	game/script.rpy	8316	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_fbdb02b6	w	I suspect He knows more than he's letting on, but sadly His comments have been completely unscientific. Totally useless for an experiment like this.	game/script.rpy	8317	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_c516578a_1	w	No, I've only found one way to detect the change.	game/script.rpy	8318	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_7c57e5e3	pov	I... well...	game/script.rpy	8320	pov "[what]"
witchExperiments_7f90118d	pov	I don't think you can, can you?	game/script.rpy	8321	pov "[what]"
witchExperiments_f0443a78	w	String.	game/script.rpy	8323	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_b7cbc602		She reached up and quickly tugged at each piece of string in the window in turn. Most of them held firm. One of them showed no resistance when she tugged.	game/script.rpy	8324	"[what]"
witchExperiments_ca7c5330		She pulled that one through the window. It was a long, long piece and she rapidly wound it up until the end came through the window.	game/script.rpy	8325	"[what]"
witchExperiments_6e2ac586		The end was tied into a loop with nothing inside.	game/script.rpy	8326	"[what]"
witchExperiments_719d18c0	w	You see?	game/script.rpy	8327	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_7d346e3c	w	When an object vanishes, everything around it stays the same.	game/script.rpy	8328	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_0a05f176	w	So even though the fork is gone, the string remains.	game/script.rpy	8329	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_d389b9ec		She pronounced this last part with maniacal glee.	game/script.rpy	8330	"[what]"
witchExperiments_dd6f49f9	w	The phenomenon seems to be able to wipe objects from our memories, but it's not a perfect deletion. The physical signs that the object used to exist are still there.	game/script.rpy	8331	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_d15dd227	w	So when I pull back a piece of string that no longer has a fork in it, that means a fork must have been there, and it disappeared.	game/script.rpy	8332	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_f7a25e8f	w	From there it was simple. All I had to do is tie all my forks with pieces of string, and laying them out in a grid network, and record the location of each piece of string that doesn't have a fork in it. 	game/script.rpy	8333	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_faf09acf		She carefully placed the string next to a big row of other pieces of looped string. Then she pointed at the writing on her wall that said "I OWN TWENTY SEVEN FORKS."	game/script.rpy	8334	"[what]"
witchExperiments_6cb908be	w	This message says I own twenty seven forks. But I have thirteen forkless pieces of string. That means at least thirteen forks have disappeared since this experiment began.	game/script.rpy	8335	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_7f6552a9	w	The question then of course is, why has the message changed to fit the new forkless reality - yet the strings are left behind?	game/script.rpy	8336	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_a3024227	w	Does this anomaly have some kind of limited ability to warp language, specifically?	game/script.rpy	8337	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_10397690	w	It almost seems to suggest some kind of active sentience behind it. It notices some things, and changes them, but misses other things. Like it's been carelessly censored.	game/script.rpy	8338	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_50135aed		She whipped out her pencil and began recording a pattern of dots on her grid.	game/script.rpy	8339	"[what]"
witchExperiments_6c3435af		You noticed a place in the top left of the grid labelled "INCIDENT ZONE".	game/script.rpy	8340	"[what]"
witchExperiments_d96039c9	pov	So... where are the disappearances coming from?	game/script.rpy	8341	pov "[what]"
witchExperiments_7c4a93e2	pov	Is that what your grid shows?	game/script.rpy	8342	pov "[what]"
witchExperiments_21086076	w	That's why I was so glad to speak to you.	game/script.rpy	8343	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_eac8f6ec		She tapped the INCIDENT ZONE label.	game/script.rpy	8344	"[what]"
witchExperiments_455cbb46	w	It's your house.	game/script.rpy	8345	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_bf904c87	w	And it seems to be moving outward.	game/script.rpy	8346	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_b26797a7		You noticed a small closet in the back of the cottage, with a sign on the door said "Experiment Site 3".	game/script.rpy	8351	"[what]"
witchExperiments_226ca540	pov	What's that one?	game/script.rpy	8352	pov "[what]"
witchExperiments_f1d90117	w	Hmm?	game/script.rpy	8353	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_80d60fb0	w	Oh... I, uh...	game/script.rpy	8354	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_3e085dc0		She looked confused.	game/script.rpy	8355	"[what]"
witchExperiments_e5b3eede		You opened the closet and peered in carefully.	game/script.rpy	8356	"[what]"
witchExperiments_188ae484		Inside was a tiny set of gentlemen's clothes, carefully folded on a stool. Small enough for a rat to wear.	game/script.rpy	8357	"[what]"
witchExperiments_6c7ec6fd		A tiny top hat was placed on top of the pile, with a pair of miniature dress shoes next to it.	game/script.rpy	8358	"[what]"
witchExperiments_7f135446	pov	What is this?	game/script.rpy	8359	pov "[what]"
witchExperiments_275e7445		The longer you stared at tiny bundle of clothes, the more a sense of powerful and implicit wrongness crawled under your skin.	game/script.rpy	8360	"[what]"
witchExperiments_fcbf89d4		Something about them didn't fit. They didn't belong here.	game/script.rpy	8361	"[what]"
witchExperiments_400b272f	w	I don't remember this.	game/script.rpy	8362	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_858c949b		The closet was suffocating. There was barely room to breathe. You felt the urge to get out in the fresh air.	game/script.rpy	8363	"[what]"
witchExperiments_f332133d		You forced yourself to move closer to the clothes. You picked up one of the tiny dress shoes. The bottom was encrusted with mud.	game/script.rpy	8364	"[what]"
witchExperiments_714f817f	pov	They must be the clothes from... an old childhood toy you used to have.	game/script.rpy	8365	pov "[what]"
witchExperiments_849c2f86	pov	It's probably nothing.	game/script.rpy	8366	pov "[what]"
witchExperiments_ccae651a	w	Of course. Yes of course, that must be it!	game/script.rpy	8367	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_adff6eee	w	I remember now. Nothing at all. Just an old toy.	game/script.rpy	8368	w "[what]"
witchExperiments_d241bdb7		Dark spots swam at the corners of your vision. You dropped the shoe and staggered out of the closet.	game/script.rpy	8385	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_fc7e0645		You felt a strangling pressure in your throat.	game/script.rpy	8392	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_b4d9f745	w	Now that we know this Lacuna is coming from your house, we can -	game/script.rpy	8393	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_4ef597de		Your tongue was fat and poisonous in your mouth.	game/script.rpy	8394	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_b83f0d4f		It twisted, and spoke.	game/script.rpy	8395	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_ef45a91f	pov	This is an exciting theory, isn't it?	game/script.rpy	8396	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_02d30eca	pov	It makes you the hero. A visionary.	game/script.rpy	8397	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_081d173f	pov	You saw what no-one else could. Now only you can stop it. Thrilling.	game/script.rpy	8398	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_1a90fb7a	pov	But I think you are overlooking a much simpler explanation.	game/script.rpy	8399	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_7dd42144	w	What do you mean?	game/script.rpy	8400	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_d8170736	pov	Memory loss. Confusion.	game/script.rpy	8401	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_a8c952ed	pov	Difficulty performing familiar tasks.	game/script.rpy	8402	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_aa0726ae	pov	Withdrawing from friends and family.	game/script.rpy	8403	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_29153407	pov	Losing the ability to think clearly.	game/script.rpy	8404	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_d2ec55ba	pov	What do these symptoms suggest to you?	game/script.rpy	8405	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_c9e82a90	w	I-	game/script.rpy	8406	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_33b376e3	w	No. No, that's not possible.	game/script.rpy	8407	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_e611144f		Her voice was unsteady.	game/script.rpy	8408	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_c328612c	w	I- I know I have struggled in the past. But it's not just me. We proved it.	game/script.rpy	8409	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_9b9bbf62	w	It can't just be in my head. What about the strings?	game/script.rpy	8410	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_093bdec8	pov	What strings?	game/script.rpy	8411	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_1eb376ba		She turned around. There were no strings on the windowsill.	game/script.rpy	8412	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_f3c6394e		The floor of the cottage was clear. There were no flags.	game/script.rpy	8413	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_5c59a5ee		There never were.	game/script.rpy	8414	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_e7595979	w	That's - I can't - what about the forks?	game/script.rpy	8415	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_87afd897	pov	You're confused, dear. You don't own any forks.	game/script.rpy	8416	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_edbf97f1	pov	Don't you remember? You never have. 	game/script.rpy	8417	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_4a590cd6		The witch looked out the window and saw that you were right. The ground was bare. The cottage was empty. There were no forks in sight.	game/script.rpy	8418	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_08dc1047		Your throat pulsed and pushed the words out of your teeth.	game/script.rpy	8419	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_84a5b5bb	pov	You eat with your hands. Your bare hands. Like an animal.	game/script.rpy	8420	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_349ff043	pov	Your claws. Your teeth.	game/script.rpy	8421	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_51efc0ee	pov	You always have. You told me so.	game/script.rpy	8422	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_4070d93e	w	No. No, I wouldn't do that. They have to be here.	game/script.rpy	8423	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_3d463873		The witch began to ransack the house, pulling out drawers and shelves, but there was nothing inside.	game/script.rpy	8424	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_1d6f1755		On the wall was a smeared message in bright red paint. It said "I OWN NOTHING."	game/script.rpy	8425	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_e7e964f6	pov	I'm worried about you, dear. We all are.	game/script.rpy	8426	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_6ec38e2d	pov	Staying all alone in this tiny, tiny cottage, all by yourself. It's barely enough room to fit.	game/script.rpy	8427	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_27377b79		The walls pressed in on you. You didn't even have space to stand fully upright.	game/script.rpy	8428	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_11f12ac5	pov	We've known each other for so long.	game/script.rpy	8429	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_8d47662a	w	We have?	game/script.rpy	8430	w "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_c30e55d4		You felt your throat muscles burn as they constricted in your throat. Your voice came out, sounding soft and comforting.	game/script.rpy	8431	"[what]"
witchSoloFinale_d93502ab	pov	Of course. So many years now. We wouldn't lie to you. We only want you to be safe.	game/script.rpy	8432	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_f0b9861b	pov	You have to trust me. You're not well. These things you're seeing... they aren't there.	game/script.rpy	8433	pov "[what]"
witchSoloFinale_0e080ca6		The witch spoke in a very small voice.	game/script.rpy	8434	"[what]"

allVanishedEnd_3f5d4e12		You sat alone in your silent corroding house in an empty forest that had no name.	game/script.rpy	10374	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_4ec97ac2		Every day, you barred the windows and stopped up the cracks with plaster and kept your door locked and barred against the vacuum of the corpse-world outside.	game/script.rpy	10375	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_b192514c		But still it came, seeping in through the crevices of your home in a slow, crushing flood, pressing in with such force you could barely breathe.	game/script.rpy	10376	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_d347912a		The worst was when you tried to sleep.	game/script.rpy	10377	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_a7ea1be4		Each night you lay rigid in your bed, listening to the sound of the fire slowly die until there was nothing left to protect you, and you could do nothing but lie in the endless suffocating abyss of silence, unable to even hear your own breathing, until at last you fell asleep and dreamed of silence.	game/script.rpy	10378	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_fea9093c		The silence was in everything. It penetrated your meat and your bones and soaked deep into your brain. There were deep empty silent chasms in your thoughts. Things you were no longer able to think.	game/script.rpy	10379	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_511be69d		You had lived in this house for as long as you could remember, which was three days.	game/script.rpy	10380	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_e654e007		There were many beds for you to sleep on. The pantry was fully stocked with food for you to eat. In the closets, you found many outfits to wear, of all shapes and sizes.

allVanishedEnd_d3956308		Like all other things, your house slowly fell day by day into greater and greater ruin as the vast unstoppable silence of the universe ground it into dirt, piece by piece.	game/script.rpy	10389	"[what]"
allVanishedEnd_9676881f		Soon the lacuna would be total and all-encompassing. Nothing would be left. And that was just about alright by you. You found you had no opinions on the matter one way or the other.	game/script.rpy	10390	"[what]"

wolfSilence_b3003be8		I was possessed of seven horrors (or, in your tongue you might say "Auras" or "Glamours of terrible splendour") which lay upon me like seven cloaks.	game/script.rpy	10493	"[what]"
wolfSilence_ac95a19c		My face was a single coiling line, like the entrails of men and beasts, from which omens can be read.	game/script.rpy	10494	"[what]"
wolfSilence_e038425e		I never knew a mother or father. I was born of the mountain.	game/script.rpy	10495	"[what]"

wolfSilence_4ca8e1f9		I will be cunning. But you will be brave.	game/script.rpy	10541	"[what]"

wolfSilence_4e6e4d77		It has been built into every fibre of the human machine.	game/script.rpy	10554	"[what]"
wolfSilence_fd1dc444		No one individual human can stop it. You can't even understand the scope of it.	game/script.rpy	10555	"[what]"
wolfSilence_2b411413		I offer you a better evil.	game/script.rpy	10556	"[what]"
