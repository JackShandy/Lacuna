Of course I gave him my assurances immediately, and thus he told me that the devil's seven daughters were locked below the city in chains, and could only be released with the most secret and magical word, \"Grolabicon\"! Of course if this were ever to be discovered and the daughters released, they would wreak such terrible havoc on the world as to bring the sun and stars falling from their place in the firmament, and it would be the eigth and final apocalypse come at last, which is why I gave him my word that I would keep the secret safe as houses, and I have never told anyone of the matter to this day."
