##====================================================== VARIABLES
## Here is a list of the variables you may need to use while writing the translation.

## The Player Pronouns
    # if he == "they":
    #     "Spanish Text for They/Them Pronouns"
    # elif he == "she":
    #     "Spanish Text for She/Her Pronouns"
    # elif he == "he":
    #     "Spanish Text for He/Him Pronouns"

## The Player Name
#[povname]. Insert into text like: "Your name is [povname]."

## [persistent.finaleTitle]: The title you chose for the end of the book. Only used once.

##Your godparent
    # if godfather == "White":
    #   "Text for G-d"
    #elif godfather == "Red":
    #   "Text for The Devil"
    #elif godfather == "Black":
    #   "Text for Death"

#The credits have a bunch more variables but we can worry about those later.

##====================================================== The Three Godparents
## This is taken from the classic Brother's Grimm Tale, Godfather Death. Also inspired by The Three Godfathers.
## https://sites.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm044.html

##============= First Godparent: G-d
## Note that G-d is censored because it refers to the deity - Godparent is not censored because it doesn't refer to Him.
## Some parts of the text are a little strange like this - it's meant to feel like an imperfect translation of an earlier work.

# game/script.rpy:1823
translate Spanish chapter1_167ac34b:

    # "In the darkness of the forest, she may or may not have met a man in white."
    ""

##=== This interjection is taken from a technique common to Grimm's stories, where the storyteller often cuts in with their own thoughts, feelings and opinions.
## These interjections come from The Wolf, who is telling the story. They are meant to feel a little strange  and offputting.
## The Wolf is an unreliable narrator, sly and sinister. This is the first indication of this.

Well, we can't have this sort of thing going on, Brilebrogue, I said to myself, and so I paid the blighter a visit and gave her a stern talking-to, and no mistake.
