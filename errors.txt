A single copy of the original manuscript (since lost) was recovered from a fire in the eighteenth century and then transcribed, translated and adapted. The work almost defeated me. Many parts of the original manuscript are gone forever. The broken lines throughout indicate lacunae in the text."{/size}{/alpha}"  #
